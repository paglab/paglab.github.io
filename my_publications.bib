	abstract = {Immediate detection and prediction tools for interactive stresses are essential to avoid yield losses. This study investigated the capability of hyperspectral (HSI) and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI) to characterize individual and interactive frost (−4 °C) and drought (40\% soil moisture content) stress responses at the booting stage of wheat under controlled environmental conditions. HSI full range reflectance (280–2500 nm), CFI, and traditional responses (leaf water content, photosynthesis, and enzymatic activity) were measured from flag leaves. The potentiality of HSI to detect cellular damage in terms of enzymatic activity was explored by developing partial least square regression (PLSR) models, and spectral indices were calculated to characterize the responses to individual and combined stresses. Reflectance in 360, 700, 1400, 1900, and 2460 nm wavebands showed the most important variables in developing PLSR models for enzymes. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase showed the highest R2c (0.99, 0.95, and 0.98), R2v (0.94, 0.90, 0.93), and the ratio of prediction to deviation (4.04, 3.06, and 3.85). CFI decreased under individual frost and combined frost and drought stresses. Ratio vegetation stress index (RVSI), green difference vegetation index (GDVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were the most important variables and could be used to detect combined frost and drought by determining enzymatic activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS), verified by PLSR models. Spectral indices and enzyme activities showed a strong correlation in determining yield losses. Hence, HSI and CFI techniques successfully detected combined frost and drought stresses for rapid quantification.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) remobilization is a critical process that provides substantial N to winter wheat grains for improving yield productivity. Here, the remobilization of N from anthesis to maturity in two wheat cultivars under three irrigation regimes was measured and its relationship to organ N concentration was examined. Based on spectral data of organ powder samples, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were calibrated to estimate N concentration (Nmass) and validated against with laboratory-based measurements. Although spectral reflectance could accurately estimate Nmass, the PLSR-based Nmass-spectra predictive model was found to be organ-specific, organs at the top canopy (chaff and top three leaves) received the best predictions (R2 {\textgreater}0.88). In addition, N remobilization efficiency (NRE) in the top two leaves and top third internode was highly correlated with its corresponding N concentration change (ΔNmass) with a R2 of 0.90. ΔNmass of the top first internode (TIN1) explained 78\% variation of the whole-plant NRE. This study provides a proof of concept for estimating N concentration and assessing N remobilization using hyperspectral data of individual organs, which offers a non-chemical and low-cost approach to screen germplasms for an optimal NRE in drought-resistance breeding.},

	abstract = {The ability of a genotype to stay green affects the primary target traits grain yield (GY) and grain protein concentration (GPC) in wheat. High throughput methods to assess senescence dynamics in large field trials will allow for i) indirect selection in early breeding generations, when yield cannot yet be accurately determined and ii) mapping of the genomic regions controlling the trait. The aim of this study was to develop a robust method to assess senescence based on hyperspectral canopy reflectance. Measurements were taken in three years throughout the grain filling phase on {\textgreater}300 winter wheat varieties in the spectral range from 350 to 2500 nm using a spectroradiometer. We compared the potential of spectral indices (SI) and full-spectrum models to infer visually observed senescence dynamics from repeated reflectance measurements. Parameters describing the dynamics of senescence were used to predict GY and GPC and a feature selection algorithm was used to identify the most predictive features. The three-band plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) approximated the visually observed senescence dynamics best, whereas full-spectrum models suffered from a strong year-specificity. Feature selection identified visual scorings as most predictive for GY, but also PSRI ranked among the most predictive features while adding additional spectral features had little effect. Visually scored delayed senescence was positively correlated with GY ranging from r = 0.173 in 2018 to r = 0.365 in 2016. It appears that visual scoring remains the gold standard to quantify leaf senescence in moderately large trials. However, using appropriate phenotyping platforms, the proposed index-based parameterization of the canopy reflectance dynamics offers the critical advantage of upscaling to very large breeding trials.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of floret initiation/abortion has been explored widely; however, the mechanisms of increasing floret fertility at anthesis in wheat production remain unclear. In this study, morphological and physiological responses of florets per spikelet and per spike to nitrogen and irrigation treatments in the field were investigated. Each spikelet produced the maximum number of living floret primordia (MFP) and showed no difference between treatments at the W7.5 stage; this ability was hardly affected by treatments. We firstly found that gradually abortive florets during W8.5-W10 stages were delayed due to improving assimilates availability in the spike instead of the 4th-5th inthernode; in fact, these florets would be aborted completely and never become fertile florets. Notably, we found that those florets in which the anther turned green (value ≥ 97) at W7.5 always became fertile, and their number showed a significant positive relationship with number of fertile florets (NFF) at W10. Collectively, more available assimilates in spike accelerated anther turning green during period of early floret development, maintained their development normally and becoming fertile florets, but did not make florets that initiate abortion become fertile florets and increase the MFP.},

	abstract = {Declining urban tree health can affect critical ecosystem services, such as air quality improvement, temperature moderation, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation. The application of state-of-the-art remote sensing data to characterize tree health has been widely examined in forest ecosystems. However, such application to urban trees has not yet been fully explored\&mdash;due to the presence of heterogeneous tree species and backgrounds, severely complicating the classification of tree health using remote sensing information. In this study, tree health was represented by a set of field-assessed tree health indicators (defoliation, discoloration, and a combination thereof), which were classified using airborne laser scanning (ALS) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with a Random Forest classifier. Different classification scenarios were established aiming at: (i) Comparing the performance of ALS data, HSI and their combination, and (ii) examining to what extent tree species mixtures affect classification accuracy. Our results show that although the predictive power of ALS and HSI indices varied between tree species and tree health indicators, overall ALS indices performed better. The combined use of both ALS and HSI indices results in the highest accuracy, with weighted kappa coefficients (Kc) ranging from 0.53 to 0.79 and overall accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. Overall, the most informative remote sensing indices indicating urban tree health are ALS indices related to point density, tree size, and shape, and HSI indices associated with chlorophyll absorption. Our results further indicate that a species-specific modelling approach is advisable (Kc points improved by 0.07 on average compared with a mixed species modelling approach). Our study constitutes a basis for future urban tree health monitoring, which will enable managers to guide early remediation management.},

	abstract = {Spectral indices rarely show consistency in estimating crop traits across growth stages; thus, it is critical to simultaneously evaluate a group of spectral variables and select the most informative spectral indices for retrieving crop traits. The objective of this study was to explore the optimal spectral predictors for above-ground biomass (AGB) by applying Random Forest (RF) on three types of spectral predictors: the full spectrum, published spectral indices (Pub-SIs), and optimized spectral indices (Opt-SIs). Canopy hyperspectral reflectance of potato plants, treated with seven nitrogen (N) rates, was obtained during the tuber formation and tuber bulking from 2015 to 2016. Twelve Pub-SIs were selected, and their spectral bands were optimized using band optimization algorithms. Results showed that the Opt-SIs were the best input variables of RF models. Compared to the best empirical model based on Opt-SIs, the Opt-SIs based RF model improved the prediction of AGB, with R2 increased by 6\%, 10\%, and 16\% at the tuber formation, tuber bulking, and for across the two growth stages, respectively. The Opt-SIs can significantly reduce the number of input variables. The optimized Blue nitrogen index (Opt-BNI) and Modified red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (Opt-mND705) combined with an RF model showed the best performance in estimating potato AGB at the tuber formation stage (R2 = 0.88). In the tuber bulking stage, only using optimized Nitrogen planar domain index (Opt-NPDI) as the input variable of the RF model produced satisfactory accuracy in training and testing datasets, with the R2, RMSE, and RE being 0.92, 208.6 kg/ha, and 10.3\%, respectively. The Opt-BNI and Double-peak nitrogen index (Opt-NDDA) coupling with an RF model explained 86\% of the variations in potato AGB, with the lowest RMSE (262.9 kg/ha) and RE (14.8\%) across two growth stages. This study shows that combining the Opt-SIs and RF can greatly enhance the prediction accuracy for crop AGB while significantly reduces collinearity and redundancies of spectral data.},

However, most of the researches by far focused on the identification of sensitive bands of HIs, and have not identified the importance of formula formats to achieve their best performance. The current study aimed to investigate the response of band optimization and formula formats to canopy N concentration (CNC) of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants, and to verify the performance of HIs through optimized algorithms based on a multi-site and -year study. Three field experiments involving different potato cultivars with 3–6 N rates were conducted from 2014 to 2016 in Inner Mongolia, China. The band optimization HIs were first tested using a simulated dataset by the PROSAIL model and validation dataset from farmers’ fields. Results showed that the optimized HIs generally had more robust performances for CNC prediction than the published indices. The optimized HIs explained 56\%–74\% of the variations in potato CNC in contrast with 3\%–53\% variation of the published HIs. Compared with published HIs, band optimization could significantly improve the performance of HIs by 16\%–71\%. The choice of the formula formats affected the explanatory power of the optimized HIs by 3\%–18\%. Our study found that both the performance of HIs and the position of the sensitive bands were greatly influenced by formula formats. The results from the evaluation of noise equivalent that independent from farmers’ field and PROSAIL model showed that the best performance was from Opt-CCCI. The central sensitive bands of Opt-CCCI were found at 600, 582, 650 nm. Opt-mRER also exhibited well in noise equivalent and independent validation from farmers’ field, while they could not be verified with the PROSAIL model because of the absence of the wavebands from 340 to 400 nm. Optimization for HIs indicates that there will be a great potential to improve the use of hyperspectral sensing for the estimation of field croṕs CNC.},

A total of 20 hybrids of sorghum grains were selected from the two locations in China. Followed by FT-NIR spectral and wet-chemically measured biochemical data, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to construct the prediction models. The results showed that sorghum grain morphology and sample format affected the prediction of biochemicals. Using NIR data of grain flours generally improved the prediction compared with the use of NIR data of whole grains. In addition, using the spectra of whole grains enabled comparable predictions, which are recommended when a non-destructive and rapid analysis is required. Compared with the hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours allowed for improved predictions for tannin, cellulose, and hemicellulose using NIR data.

We investigated the physiological and phenological leaf plasticity of Tilia×euchlora trees to the UHI effect and soil sealing and explored the potential of leaf optical traits to quantify the magnitude of leaf plasticity. Temporal changes of leaf water content (LWC), specific leaf area (SLA), total chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) content, Car:Chl ratio and leaf reflectance for 46 Tilia×euchlora trees were measured along a soil sealing and urbanization gradient. The leaf functional traits displayed trait-specific temporal patterns during the growing season. We observed higher LWC and SLA but lower Chl and Car contents in the coolest zones. We found earlier autumn downregulation in Chl and Car content at paved sites compared to unsealed sites (maximum difference = 13 days). The magnitude of plasticity in relation to the UHI and soil sealing varied in leaf functional traits with largest variation observed in Chl (38\%), followed by Car:Chl (31\%), Car (29\%), SLA (26\%) and LWC (8\%). The proposed spectral indices calculated using leaf reflectance measurements were able to track the spatiotemporal variations and phenology in the leaf functional traits. Our results clearly demonstrate the leaf plasticity of Tilia×euchlora trees, which provides Tilia×euchlora trees the necessary capacity to adapt to rapid changes in the urban environment. More importantly, we demonstrated the suitability of leaf optical traits to serve as a proxy of leaf functional traits for studying the spatiotemporal response of urban trees to environmental factors, which opens up new possibilities for large scale ecological studies using remote sensing.},

To evaluate the effects of spectral portions on LAI estimation without calculating the spectral indices, (SI) we inputted each pair of spectral bands for training and testing both RF and SVM. It was found that the best correlation was lower compared to use SIs. However, R2 variations were more homogeneous across the whole spectrum, which suggests that even by using multispectral broadband bands in RF and SVM, a good correlation will be achieved.},

	abstract = {The deployment of novel technologies in the field of precision farming has risen to the top of global agendas in response to the impact of climate change and the possible shortage of resources such as water and fertilizers. The present research addresses the performance of water and nitrogen-sensitive narrow-band vegetation indices to evaluate the response of sweet maize (Zea mays var. saccharata L.) to different irrigation and nitrogen regimes. The experiment was carried out in Valenzano, Bari (Southern Italy), during the 2020 growing season. Three irrigation regimes (full irrigation, deficit irrigation, and rainfed) and two nitrogen levels (300 and 50 kg ha−1) were tested. During the growing season, a Field Spec Handheld 2 spectroradiometer operating in the range of 325–1075 nm was utilized to capture spectral data regularly. In addition, soil water content, biometric parameters, and physiological parameters were measured. The DATT index, based on near-infrared and red-edge wavelengths, performed better than other indices in explaining the variation in chlorophyll content, whereas the double difference index (DD) showed the greatest correlation with the leaf–gas exchange. The modified normalized difference vegetation index (NNDVI) and the ratio of water band index to normalized difference vegetation index (WBI/NDVI) showed the highest capacity to distinguish the interaction of irrigation x nitrogen, while the best discriminating capability of these indices was under a low nitrogen level. Moreover, red-edge-based indices had higher sensitivity to nitrogen levels compared to the structural and water band indices. Our study highlighted that it is critical to choose proper narrow-band vegetation indices to monitor the plant eco-physiological response to water and nitrogen stresses.},

This study explores the feasibility of using drone multispectral image data for real-time monitoring of maize drought stress and compares the sensitivity of drone data and field-measured agronomic indicators to crop drought stress. [Methods]Two maize cultivars, ‘Fumin 985’ and ‘Zhengdan 958’, were used as test materials in the field experiment. Border irrigation, drip irrigation, and rainfed irrigation were employed as treatments. The pigment content and specific leaf area (SLA) of the most recently unfolded maize leaves were determined at 60, 70, 76, 84, 90, and 95 days after sowing. Similarly, a UAV equipped with multi-spectral cameras was used to collect near-ground remote sensing data to extract five vegetation indexes: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), leaf chlorophyll index (LCI), and optimum soil adjust vegetation index (OSAVI). [Results]The changes in vegetation indexes were earlier than in the leaf pigment content and the leaf area index. At 70 days after sowing (tasseling period), there was a significant difference in the NDRE and LCI of the three treatments. NDVI, GNDVI, and OSAVI indexes differed between the irrigation and rain-fed modes. No difference was observed in the treatments' pigment content and specific leaf area index at the same stages. At 90 days following sowing, there was a considerable difference in pigment concentration among the treatments (filling period). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that the relationship between vegetation indexes and pigment content varied depending on the growth stage. The correlations between pigment content and two vegetation indices (NDRE and LCI) were higher for 80 days after sowing (flowering phase) than for NDVI, GNDVI, and OSAVI; for 90 days after sowing (filling period), the correlation between the five vegetation indices and pigment content was high. [Conclusions]According to this study, the utilization of UAV multi-spectral data to monitor maize drought proved better than some measured agronomic indicators. However, further research should be conducted on the best spectral indicators and periods for drought monitoring in various situations and environments. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the problems of optical remote sensing of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) is that vegetation indices (VIs) often saturate from the middle to late growth stages. This study focuses on combining VIs acquired by a consumer-grade multiple-spectral UAV and machine learning regression techniques to (i) determine the optimal time window for AGB estimation of winter wheat and to (ii) determine the optimal combination of multi-spectral VIs and regression algorithms. UAV-based multi-spectral data and manually measured AGB of winter wheat, under five nitrogen rates, were obtained from the jointing stage until 25 days after flowering in the growing season 2020/2021. Forty-four multi-spectral VIs were used in the linear regression (LR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF) models in this study. Results of LR models showed that the heading stage was the most suitable stage for AGB prediction, with R2 values varying from 0.48 to 0.93. Three PLSR models based on different datasets performed differently in estimating AGB in the training dataset (R2 = 0.74{\textasciitilde}0.92, RMSE = 0.95{\textasciitilde}2.87 t/ha, MAE = 0.75{\textasciitilde}2.18 t/ha, and RPD = 2.00{\textasciitilde}3.67) and validation dataset (R2 = 0.50{\textasciitilde}0.75, RMSE = 1.56{\textasciitilde}2.57 t/ha, MAE = 1.44{\textasciitilde}2.05 t/ha, RPD = 1.45{\textasciitilde}1.89). Compared with PLSR models, the performance of the RF models was more stable in the prediction of AGB in the training dataset (R2 = 0.95{\textasciitilde}0.97, RMSE = 0.58{\textasciitilde}1.08 t/ha, MAE = 0.46{\textasciitilde}0.89 t/ha, and RPD = 3.95{\textasciitilde}6.35) and validation dataset (R2 = 0.83{\textasciitilde}0.93, RMSE = 0.93{\textasciitilde}2.34 t/ha, MAE = 0.72{\textasciitilde}2.01 t/ha, RPD = 1.36{\textasciitilde}3.79). Monitoring AGB prior to flowering was found to be more effective than post-flowering. Moreover, this study demonstrates that it is feasible to estimate AGB for multiple growth stages of winter wheat by combining the optimal VIs and PLSR and RF models, which overcomes the saturation problem of using individual VI-based linear regression models.},

	abstract = {Deficit irrigation is a common approach in water-scarce regions to balance productivity and water use, whereas drought stress still occurs to various extents, leading to reduced physiological performance and a decrease in yield. Therefore, seeking a rapid and reliable method to identify wheat varieties with drought resistance can help reduce yield loss under water deficit. In this study, we compared ten wheat varieties under three deficit irrigation systems (W0, no irrigation during the growing season; W1, irrigation at jointing; W2, irrigation at jointing and anthesis). UAV thermal imagery, plant physiological traits [leaf area index (LAI), SPAD, photosynthesis (Pn), transpiration (Tr), stomatal conductance (Cn)], biomass and yield were acquired at different growth stages. Wheat drought resistance performance was evaluated through using the canopy temperature extracted from UAV thermal imagery (CT-UAV), in combination with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The CT-UAV of W0 and W1 treatments was significantly higher than in the W2 treatment, with the ranges of 24.8–33.3 °C, 24.3–31.6 °C, and 24.1–28.9 °C in W0, W1 and W2, respectively. We found negative correlations between CT-UAV and LAI, SPAD, Pn, Tr, Cn and biomass under the W0 (R2 = 0.41–0.79) and W1 treatments (R2 = 0.22–0.72), but little relevance for W2 treatment. Under the deficit irrigation treatments (W0 and W1), UAV thermal imagery was less effective before the grain-filling stage in evaluating drought resistance. This study demonstrates the potential of ensuring yield and saving irrigation water by identifying suitable wheat varieties for different water-scarce irrigation scenarios.},

Also, little is known about the performance of UAV-based image texture features in crop nitrogen and NUE monitoring. In this study, eight flying missions were carried out throughout different stages of winter wheat (from the jointing stage to the stage 25 days after flowering) to acquire multispectral images. Forty-three multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and forty texture features (TFs) were calculated from images and fed into the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression models for predicting nitrogen-related indicators. Our main purposes were to (1) evaluate the potential of UAV-based images to predict NC in different organs of winter wheat and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE); (2) compare the performances of VIs, TFs and the combination of them for nitrogen monitoring. The results showed that the correlation between different features (VIs and TFs) and NC in different organs varied between the vegetative and reproductive phases. Most of VIs were found to be positively correlated with NC, while most of the TFs were negatively correlated with NC. PLSR latent variables extracted from VIs and TFs explained 80\% of the variations in NAE. However, no significant differences were found between VIs and TFs in their performance in predicting NC in different organs. This study demonstrated the promise of applying UAV-based imaging to estimate NC and NAE in different organs of winter wheat.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing technology provides a promising means for near real-time monitoring of crop water status and requirements in agricultural and hydrological applications. Estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) often requires thermal information; however, not every satellite is equipped with a thermal sensor, which limits the estimation of ETa. To address this limitation, here we propose a satellite-based ETa estimation model, OPTRAM-ET, based on the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) estimates of soil moisture and a vegetation index (VI). We applied the OPTRAM-ET model to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data and evaluated the model for ETa estimates using 16 eddy covariance flux towers in the United States and Germany with different landcover types, including agriculture, orchard, permanent wetland, and foothill forests. Next, OPTRAM-ET was compared with the conventional land surface temperature (LST)-VI model. The proposed OPTRAM-ET model showed promising performance over all the studied landcover types. In addition, OPTRAM-ET showed comparable performance to the conventional LST-VI model. However, since the OPTRAM-ET model does not need thermal data, it benefits from higher spatial and temporal resolution data provided by ever-increasing drone- and satellite-based optical sensors to predict crop water status and demand. Unlike the LST-VI model, which needs to be calibrated for each satellite image, a temporally-invariant region-specific calibration is possible in the OPTRAM-ET model. Therefore, OPTRAM-ET is substantially less computationally demanding than the LST-VI model.},

	abstract = {Context
Remotely estimating plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) at the vegetative growth stage plays a crucial role in the precision N management of field crops. However, the great challenges still remain on how to overcome the impact of canopy structure variation and the ‘N-dilution’ effect on the accuracy of PNC assessment using spectral indices (SIs).
Objective
This study was to apply machine learning (ML) algorithms fed with the optimized spectral indices (OSI), sensitive spectral bands (SSB), and full-spectrum (FS) to improve the prediction accuracy of PNC in critical vegetative growth stages of wheat, maize, rice, potato and the across crops.
Methods
Four ML algorithms including the partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were compared for their efficacies in predicting PNC from ten field trials in different locations from 2005 to 2016.
Results
The input variable had a non-negligible influence on the performance of ML models. The OSI was the most efficient input variable for the tested ML algorithms in predicting PNC. The OSI-based RF models showed consistent outperformance compared to other models regardless of crops. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.51˗0.85 and the root means square error (RMSE) was 0.15\% ˗ 0.34\% in the experimental validation datasets. By choosing PNC-related spectral features across crops, the OSI-based RF models increased prediction accuracy by 10–31\% compared with the best OSI-simple regression models, which was because the OSI-based RF models may be independent of canopy structure or the "N-dilution" impact. The simulated datasets based on the PROSAIL model and satellite multispectral bands further validated the results.
Conclusions
Our study concludes that the OSI-based RF is a robust and effective model to predict crop PNC at the vegetative growth stage.
Significance
The results of this study may provide insights into how to improve PNC assessment using the OSI-based RF models and deploy ML-based N recommendation models in the next generation of crop sensors.},

	abstract = {A significant number of object detection models have been researched for use in plant detection. However, deployment and evaluation of the models for real-time detection as well as for crop counting under varying real field conditions is lacking. In this work, two versions of a state-of-the-art object detection model—YOLOv5n and YOLOv5s—were deployed and evaluated for cassava detection. We compared the performance of the models when trained with different input image resolutions, images of different growth stages, weed interference, and illumination conditions. The models were deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin embedded GPU in order to observe the real-time performance of the models. Results of a use case in a farm field showed that YOLOv5s yielded the best accuracy whereas YOLOv5n had the best inference speed in detecting cassava plants. YOLOv5s allowed for more precise crop counting, compared to the YOLOv5n which mis-detected cassava plants. YOLOv5s performed better under weed interference at the cost of a low speed. The findings of this work may serve to as a reference for making a choice of which model fits an intended real-life plant detection application, taking into consideration the need for a trade-off between of detection speed, detection accuracy, and memory usage.},

The calibration dataset consists of experimental and PROSAIL model simulated data. The RF model was validated using farmers’ fields data. The results showed that the RF model calibrated by the integrated experimental and simulated data significantly improved the explanatory power of potato chlorophyll content by 23-47\% compared with the RF model calibrated with simulated or experimental data alone, and the R2 and RMSE were 0.67 and 0.08 g/m2.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of different types of spectral bands and indices (SIs) coupled with ensemble learning models (ELMs) at retrieving the plant N concentration (PNC) and plant aboveground biomass (AGB) of potato from Sentinel-2 images. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 imagery was acquired during the tuber-formation to starch-accumulation stages from 2020 to 2021. Fourteen optimal SIs were selected using the successive projections algorithm (SPA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The PNC and AGB estimation models were then built using an ELMs. The results showed that the SIs based on chlorophyll absorption bands were strongly related to potato PNC and AGB. Also, the N-correlated bands were mainly concentrated in the red-edge (705 nm) and short-wave infrared (1610 and 2190 nm) regions. The ELMs successfully predicted PNC and AGB (R2PNC = 0.74; R2AGB = 0.82). Compared with the other five base models (k-nearest neighbor (KNN), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and Gaussian process regression (GPR)), the ELMs provided higher PNC and AGB estimation accuracy and effectively reduced overfitting to training data. This study demonstrated that the promising solution of using SPA-PCA coupled with an ensemble learning model improves the estimation accuracy of potato PNC and AGB based on Sentinel-2 imagery data.},

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based high-resolution images allow to apply CV and ML methods for the detection of plants or their organs of interest. Thus, this study presents a practical workflow based on the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) and UAV images to detect maize plants for counting their numbers in contrasting development stages, including the application of a semi-auto-labeling method based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to reduce the burden of labeling. Results showed that the trained model achieved a mean average precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.828 and 0.863 for the 3-leaf stage and 7-leaf stage, respectively. YOLOv5 achieved the best performance under the conditions of overgrown weeds, leaf occlusion, and blurry images, suggesting that YOLOv5 plays a practical role in obtaining excellent performance under realistic field conditions. Furthermore, introducing image-rotation augmentation and low noise weight enhanced model accuracy, with an increase of 0.024 and 0.016 mAP@0.5, respectively, compared to the original model of the 3-leaf stage. This work provides a practical reference for applying lightweight ML and deep learning methods to UAV images for automated object detection and characterization of plant growth under realistic environments.},

	abstract = {High throughput field phenotyping techniques employing multispectral cameras allow extracting a variety of variables and features to predict yield and yield related traits, but little is known about which types of multispectral features are optimal to forecast yield potential in the early growth phase. In this study, we aim to identify multispectral features that are able to accurately predict yield and aid in variety classification at different growth stages throughout the season. Furthermore, we hypothesize that texture features (TFs) are more suitable for variety classification than for yield prediction. Throughout 2021 and 2022, a trial involving 19 and 18 European wheat varieties, respectively, was conducted. Multispectral images, encompassing visible, Red-edge, and near-infrared (NIR) bands, were captured at 19 and 22 time points from tillering to harvest using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the first and second year of trial. Subsequently, orthomosaic images were generated, and various features were extracted, including single-band reflectances, vegetation indices (VI), and TFs derived from a gray level correlation matrix (GLCM). The performance of these features in predicting yield and classifying varieties at different growth stages was assessed using random forest models. Measurements during the flowering stage demonstrated superior performance for most features. Specifically, Red reflectance achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 52.4 g m-2 in the first year and 64.4 g m-2 in the second year. The NDRE VI yielded the most accurate predictions with an RMSE of 49.1 g m-2 and 60.6 g m-2, respectively. Moreover, TFs such as CONTRAST and DISSIMILARITY displayed the best performance in predicting yield, with RMSE values of 55.5 g m-2 and 66.3 g m-2 across the two years of trial. Combining data from different dates enhanced yield prediction and stabilized predictions across dates. TFs exhibited high accuracy in classifying low and high-yielding varieties. The CORRELATION feature achieved an accuracy of 88\% in the first year, while the HOMOGENEITY feature reached 92\% accuracy in the second year. This study confirms the hypothesis that TFs are more suitable for variety classification than for yield prediction. The results underscore the potential of TFs derived from multispectral images in early yield prediction and varietal classification, offering insights for HTP and precision agriculture alike.},

	abstract = {Drone remote sensing has been increasingly demonstrated its unique advantage of monitoring vegetation and agricultural systems, yet the degree to which the effectiveness of drone imaging based spectral features may differ in assessing the effect of soil nutrient availability on plant canopy is unclear. Soil mineralized nitrogen (Nmin) is a key factor determining crop N fertilization demand, and thus understanding its effect on yield and quality is critical for efficient fertilizer use and precise crop N management and assessing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). In this study, our objective was to understand how soil Nmin variability is associated canopy characteristics, and whether these associations are also interact with grain yield, quality and NUE. For this purpose, we employed UAV multispectral remote sensing, and plant and grain sampling and sample N content determination in wheat growing at different Nmin levels. We extracted 63 spectral features (25 texture features, canopy height, 5 multispectral bands, and 23 spectral indices) obtained from eight UAV flights of RGB and multispectral images. Effective indicators were selected using random forests and correlation, and 10 machine learning models were used to predict NUE. We identified CH, NGRDI, NDREg, and IPCA as the most predictive factors for NUE (r {\textgreater} 0.7), and the PLSR model (R2 {\textgreater} 0.8) as the best performing model. We found that the impact of Nmin on wheat primarily involves enhancing canopy structure, promoting the expansion of leaf area, thereby increasing grain yield and NUE under moderate nitrogen fertilizer levels. In contrast, there was no significant effect found on grain quality. Results also demonstrated that the red edge spectral indices and color-band indices were effective in predicting NUE as early as the flowering stage. This study demonstrates the potential of UAV remote sensing for capturing soil N effect on canopy traits and for assessing nitrogen use efficiency for the purpose of improving fertilizer utilization and environmental effects.},

In a field study covering a large pedoclimatic gradient across four European sites, we (i) compared the abundance of AM fungi in the roots of 10 modern winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties, (ii) evaluated the relative importance of variety and site for the variability in root colonization by AM fungi and (iii) tested the relationship between mycorrhizal abundance and grain yield. Root colonization by arbuscules and hyphae ranged from 10\% to 59\% and 20\% to 91\%, respectively, across all samples and varied by 8\% and 18\%, respectively, among varieties when averaged across sites. Variance decomposition analysis revealed a 10 times higher importance of site than variety for AM fungal root colonization. Specifically, we found the highest mycorrhizal abundance on the site with the most arid conditions and the lowest on the sites with low soil pH and high nutrient availability. Despite the low variability in mycorrhizal abundance among varieties, there were significant differences in both arbuscular and hyphal root colonization. However, this did not translate into an increase in yield as no significant relationships between mycorrhizal abundance at flowering and grain yield were detected. The consistent differences between wheat varieties in root colonization by AM fungi across European field sites underline that genetic drivers of mycorrhization are to some extent independent of the site. This highlights the relevance of breeding practices to shape a wheat variety's capacity for mycorrhizal symbiosis across a range of environmental conditions.},

Therefore, the aim of this study was to use UAV-based spectral indices deriving from UAV-based multispectral images as inputs in different machine learning models to predict canopy chlorophyll content of potato crops. The relative chlorophyll content was obtained using a SPAD chlorophyll meter. Random Forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and ridge regression (RR) were employed to predict the chlorophyll content. The results showed that RF model was the best performing algorithm with an R2 of 0.76, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.97. Both RF and SVR models showed much better accuracy than PLSR and RR models.

This study aims to develop deep learning based segmentation models in identifying weeds in potato fields captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) orthophotos and to explore the effects of weeds on potato yield. UAVs were used to collect RGB data from potato fields, flying at an altitude of 10m, with Real ESRGAN Super-Resolution (SR) enhancing image resolution. We applied the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to do semi-automatic annotation, followed by training the YOLOv8 and MASK-RCNN models for segmentation. Also we used ANOVA and linear regression to analyze the effects of weeds and nitrogen fertilizer on yield. Results showed that the detection accuracy mAP50 scores for YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN were 0.902 and 0.920, respectively, with the Real-ESRGAN-enhanced model achieving 0.909. When multiple weed types were present, accuracy decreased to 0.86. The linear regression model, incorporating plant and weed coverage areas, explained 41.2\% of yield variation (R2 = 0.412, p-value = 0.01). Both YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN achieved high accuracy, with YOLOv8 converging faster. Real-ESRGAN reconstruction slightly improved accuracy. Different nitrogen fertilizer treatments had no significant effect on yield, while weed control treatments significantly impacted yield, showing the importance of precise weed mapping. This study provides insights into weed segmentation and contributes to environmentally friendly precision weed control.},

	abstract = {The process of crop type mapping generates land use maps, which serve as critical tools for efficient evaluation of production factors and impacts of agricultural practice. Yet, despite the necessity for comprehensive solutions in space and time, the state of research still exhibits significant limitations in these two dimensions: (1) From a temporal perspective, the primary focus of past research in crop type mapping has been on the economically most meaningful, main-season crops, thereby largely neglecting the explicit study of off-season vegetation despite its pivotal roles in year-round management cycles. (2) Viewed spatially, study areas in crop type mapping show distinct limitations from a multi- and transnational standpoint, despite intense cross-regional and international interrelations of agricultural production and an increasing number of countries publishing crop reference data. With a focus on Europe, this research aims to tackle the two described shortcomings (a) by investigating to what extent a selection of major off-season, winter vegetation types in continental Europe can be classified and (b) by analyzing the transnational applicability of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) for remote sensing-based crop type mapping across the European Union (EU). This study uses ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellite data, EU’s administrative farming declarations, and HCAT labels to analyze off-season farming measures, based on a study period from late summer to spring, in Austria, France, Germany, and Slovenia. We demonstrate that deep learning models effectively identify major productive and agroecogically significant winter vegetation in continental Europe. HCAT proves thereby valuable for transnational crop classification, excelling in mixed-country experiments and showing potential for transfer learning. This study’s findings provide a solid foundation for advancing transnational as well as winter and all-year crop type mapping, thereby serving as contribution towards temporally and spatially holistic research on agricultural practices’ sociocultural, economic, and environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {Ensuring global food security depends heavily on attaining and sustaining high maize yields. However, effective N fertilisation management and precise predictions of maize yields require accurate and timely estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). In this study, we determined the optimal spectral features for predicting LCC in maize by comparing spectral indices and wavelet features. The robustness of the wavelet functions in estimating maize LCC was evaluated, and the results showed that LCC was strongly correlated with the wavelet coefficient between 400 and 800 nm, located at higher scales (9 and 10). The best wavelet function for estimating LCC was the Mexican hat (Mexh) continuous wavelet transform (CWT) (W718, S9). Compared with the currently accepted best spectral index model (mND705, R2 = 0.80–0.95), the LCC estimation model based on the CWT wavelet function (Mexh, R2 = 0.90–0.98) was more accurate. The newly developed model was validated using two independent datasets, from 2017 and 2018, yielding root mean squared errors of 2.35 and 2.39 μg/cm2, respectively. The relative errors of LCC estimation obtained by the new model were 3.70\% and 3.62\%, respectively. Validations based on the PROSPECT model confirmed the robustness and stability of the CWT Mexh function compared to the best-performing spectral indices. In conclusion, the higher estimation accuracy of the Mexh function-based wavelet transform across growth stages, leaf layers, locations, and varieties demonstrated the universality and stability of the wavelet transform approach in estimating maize LCC.},

These variations present challenges for remote sensing-based tree species classification and effective urban forest management. However, few studies have explored how planting contexts influence the accuracy of remote sensing-based tree species identification in urban environments. This study introduced a planting context-specific modelling approach (i.e., models trained for street trees and park trees separately) for classifying seven dominant broadleaved tree species in the Brussels Capital Region, Belgium using airborne hyperspectral and leaf-on LiDAR data. This approach was compared to a traditional general modelling approach. Linear discriminant analysis with principal component analysis was employed to classify tree species at the individual tree level using different feature sets. Our results showed that a planting context-specific modelling approach with combined hyperspectral and LiDAR features achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 84.2\%. It improved the OA of LiDAR-based classifications by 7.6 and 8.9 percentage points for street trees and park trees respectively and of hyperspectral-based street tree species classification by 4.2 percentage points. The decreased discriminatory power of features in general models can be partly attributed to their sensitivity to planting context. We concluded that a planting context-specific modeling approach can enhance urban tree species classification, ultimately supporting improved urban forest management.},

This study aimed to develop an efficient model for predicting winter wheat plant N concentration (PNC) by integrating proximal hyperspectral sensing data with weather information. Hyperspectral data were collected from six field experiments conducted from 2014 to 2023, which were preprocessed using first-order derivative, log-transformation, and continuum removal methods. Effective spectral bands were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), combined with weather information and analyzed using seven machine learning algorithms. The results indicated that first-order derivative-preprocessed bands combined with Elastic Net Regression provided the best PNC prediction (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.78, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.28 \% and relative prediction deviation (RPD) = 2.15) among the tested methods. Combining proximal hyperspectral sensing and weather information with machine learning algorithms significantly enhanced winter wheat PNC predictions (R2 = 0.79–0.85, RMSE = 0.23–0.27 \% and RPD = 2.15–2.56) compared with using proximal hyperspectral sensing (R2 = 0.34–0.79, RMSE = 0.28–0.48 \% and RPD = 1.23–2.15) alone. This approach offers a promising framework for winter wheat PNC prediction to support precision N management.

	abstract = {Context
Accurate and real-time diagnosis of crop nitrogen (N) status is essential for effective precision N management. Integrating the N nutrition index (NNI) with spectral non-destructive rapid monitoring technologies offers a promising approach to precision N management for field crops. However, applying spectral sensing technologies for providing fertilizer recommendations based on real-time plant N nutrition diagnosis for drip-irrigated maize in arid regions remains challenging.
Objective
Our study set out to leverage spectroscopic techniques to accurately diagnose maize N status at pre- and post-anthesis. Our goal was to develop a novel spectral index that could guide site-specific fertigation strategies in arid environments.
Methods
The comprehensive field experiments with three maize varieties and different N levels were conducted from 2021 to 2023 in Inner Mongolia, China. Spectral reflectance, biomass, and leaf N concentrations were determined at various layers of maize plants across five growth stages. A Bayesian model to estimate leaf-based NNI was employed to develop leaf-based critical N concentration dilution curves for different ecological sites. The nitrogen nutrient triangle ratio index (NTRI), a key outcome of our research, was constructed using first-order derivative spectral reflectance between 680 and 750 nm. We then compared the NNI prediction accuracies of NTRI with 29 published spectral indices, ensuring the robustness of our findings.
Results
Compared to NNI prediction models based on twenty-nine published spectral indices, our newly developed NTRI demonstrated a superior correlation to NNI (R² = 0.83). Independent validation confirmed NTRI’s robustness, yielding an RMSE of 0.11 \% and RE of 9.6 \%, surpassing existing indices.
Conclusions
Pre-anthesis N diagnosis was most sensitive to spectral diagnosis from the latest fully expanded leaf, while post-anthesis N diagnosis relied on ear leaves. NTRI’s accuracy and resistance to varietal and interannual variability highlight its potential application for real-time N monitoring.
Significance
Our innovative spectral index NTRI significantly advances spectral N nutrition diagnostics, enabling leaf-layer sensing and smart fertigation systems. This breakthrough paves the way for sustainable, high-yield maize production in arid regions.},

The study objectives were to: (a) quantify root biomass and depth distribution in different winter wheat varieties under various pedoclimatic conditions, (b) investigate the influence of variety and pedoclimatic conditions on the relationship between above- and belowground biomass production, and (c) assess whether optimised winter wheat variety selection can lead to both greater root biomass C and yield, boosting C accrual. Root biomass, root distribution to 1 m soil depth and root-to-shoot ratios were assessed in 10 different winter wheat varieties grown at 11 experimental sites covering a European climatic gradient from Spain to Norway. Median root biomass down to 1 m depth was 1.4 ± 0.7 Mg ha−1. The primary explanatory factor was site, accounting for 60\% of the variation in root biomass production, while the genetic diversity between wheat varieties explained 9.5\%. Precipitation had a significantly negative effect on total root biomass, especially in subsoil. Significant differences were also observed between varieties in root-to-shoot ratios and grain yield. The difference between the variety with the lowest root biomass and the one with the highest across sites was on average 0.9 Mg ha−1 which is an increase of 45\%. Pedoclimatic conditions had a greater influence than variety, and determined the relationship's direction between root biomass and grain yield. A site-specific approach is, therefore, needed to realise the full potential for increased root biomass and yield offered by optimised variety selection.},

	abstract = {Although unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely used for high-throughput crop monitoring, few attempts have been made to assess nitrogen content (NC) at the organ level and its association with nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Also, little is known about the performance of UAV-based image texture features of different spectral bands in monitoring crop nitrogen and NUE. In this study, multi-spectral images were collected throughout different stages of winter wheat in two independent field trials - a single-variety field trial and a multi-variety trial in 2021 and 2022, respectively in China and Germany. Forty-three multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and forty texture features (TFs) were calculated from images and fed into the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression models for predicting nitrogen-related indicators. Our main objectives were to (1) assess the potential of UAV-based multispectral imagery for predicting NC in different organs of winter wheat, (2) explore the transferability of different image features (VI and TF) and trained machine learning models in predicting NC, and (3) propose a technical workflow for mapping NUE using UAV imagery. The results showed that the correlation between different features (VIs and TFs) and NC in different organs varied between the pre-anthesis and post-anthesis stages. PLSR latent variables extracted from those VIs and TFs could be a great predictor for nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE). While adding TFs to VI-based models enhanced the model performance in predicting NC, inconsistency arose when applying the TF-based models trained based on one dataset to the other independent dataset that involved different varieties, UAVs, and cameras. Unsurprisingly, models trained with the multi-variety dataset show better transferability than the models trained with the single-variety dataset. This study not only demonstrates the promise of applying UAV-based imaging to estimate NC in different organs and map NUE in winter wheat but also highlights the importance of conducting model evaluations based on independent datasets.},

	abstract = {Feature selection methods are widely used to improve the performance of plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) estimation models. However, the performance of individual feature selection methods can vary across different environments due to various uncertainties. This study aimed to propose a hybrid feature selection method to accurately identify the sensitive bands for the PNC estimation. Field experiments with different potato cultivars and N treatments were carried out in the Inner Mongolia during 2018, 2019, and 2021. The results showed that the hybrid feature selection method can effectively identify the sensitive bands for PNC. When combined with variational heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression (VHGPR), the hybrid method significantly improves the prediction accuracy of potato PNC. Validation using an independent dataset demonstrated that the hybrid feature selection method achieved the highest prediction accuracy compared to traditional feature selection methods, with the mean coefficient of determination (R²) increasing by 16.27 \%. Additionally, the performance of VHGPR was benchmarked against partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results indicated that the VHGPR model outperforms the PLSR model across various data types, with a mean R² improvement of 8.92 \%. In conclusion, combining the hybrid feature selection method with VHGPR can facilitate real-time PNC estimation in the field, thereby assisting farmers in accurately applying nitrogen fertilization strategies.},

	abstract = {In urban community gardens, artificially managed ground cover types, including vegetative components and non-vegetative ground components, are both critical to ecological functioning. Yet, how these non-vegetative components influence spectral diversity in ways that are different from natural systems has not been addressed. This study investigated the potential of combining spectral and structural diversity variables, corresponding to the Spectral Variation and Height Variation Hypotheses, respectively, to monitor plant and ground cover diversity. These variables were derived from in-situ hyperspectral measurements, drone-based multispectral imagery and three-dimensional canopy height models. We examined four biodiversity variables including plant species richness, total plant abundances, ground cover entropy, and ground cover richness, across five urban community gardens over two years. Spectral diversity was calculated based on the Coefficient of Variation (CV), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and Shannon’s Entropy (Entropy) indices at multiple spectral ranges. Structural diversity variables, including canopy height variation and image texture features. Our results showed that RedEdge and Near-infrared (NIR) bands effectively captured compositional variation in ground cover, while visible wavelengths better reflected subtle differences in vegetative components. Texture features and height-based structural variables provided valuable insights into canopy complexity, particularly improving predictions of plant abundance and ground cover entropy. Finally, we found that integrating spectral and structural diversity variables further enhanced predictive performance due to considering canopy biochemical and structural differences. This multi-metric approach outperformed single-source analyses, underscoring the value of combining complementary remote sensing data for better interpreting urban garden biodiversity. Our findings highlight the importance of characterizing canopy structural heterogeneity in advancing biodiversity monitoring within these complex urban ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Drone remote sensing offers a powerful tool for monitoring vegetation and agricultural systems. However, its effectiveness in assessing the effect of soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) on crop canopy traits remains inadequately explored. This study investigates the relationship between soil Nmin variability and canopy characteristics, grain yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and explores the potential to predict NUE using drone multispectral images. Multispectral data were collected across growth stages over two growing seasons. The analysis revealed that soil Nmin significantly affected canopy structure, with low Nmin inducing a ’blue shift’ of the red-edge spectral position. The multilayer perceptron regression model predicted NUE with high accuracy (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7) in early growth stages, identifying red-edge spectral indices and canopy height as key predictors. Texture features did not play a significant role in the models for predicting NUE, which remains to be further understood in future research. These findings highlight the capability of UAV remote sensing data, especially the red-edge spectral features, to capture the effects of soil Nmin on canopy traits. This study provides a proof-of-concept for mapping NUE using UAV images, with the final goal of improving crop nitrogen management and fertilizer use efficiency in agriculture.},

	abstract = {With the increasing availability of Earth observation data in recent years, the development of deep learning algorithms for the classification of satellite image time series (SITS) has substantially progressed. Yet, when encountering settings of lacking target labels and distinct feature variations, even the latest classification algorithms may perform poorly in transferring knowledge from a trained dataset to an unknown target dataset, despite similar or even identical label sets. The research field of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) focuses on methods to overcome these challenges by providing algorithms that explicitly learn domain shifts between different data domains in the absence of target-labeled data. Building upon recent advances on generic UDA research in time series settings, we propose RAINCOAT-SRS, an enhancement of the frequency-augmented UDA-algorithm RAINCOAT specifically for the SITS domain. To evaluate the default and adjusted model variants, we designed several closed-label set, cross-regional and multi-temporal crop type mapping experiments, which represent common sub-problems of UDA in SITS. We first benchmark RAINCOAT against TimeMatch as a leading algorithm in this application context. Subsequently, we explored different encoder-to-decoder constellations as architectural enhancements. These analyses revealed that a combination of an self-attention-based encoder with the default decoder yields a performance increase to the standard algorithm of up to 6 \% in average f1-score, and to TimeMatch by up to 24 \%. Beyond, we assessed the impact of the frequency feature and SITS-specific feature extensions by integrating weather data, which both showed to improve classification accuracy only in individual sub-experiments however not consistently across the entire scope of scenarios. Finally, we outline key factors influencing the transferability, thereby emphasizing the major importance of domain-overarching stability of class-relative, structural patterns rather than of collective, linear shifts between domains. Through this research, we introduce RAINCOAT-SRS, a novel model for UDA in SITS, designed to advance generalization in remote sensing by enabling more comprehensive cross-regional and multi-temporal SITS experiments in face of lacking target-labeled data.},

Despite the advances in high-resolution RGB imagery using drone technologies, inconsistency remains regarding the use of color vegetation indices (VIs) and texture information in modeling AGB in different growth stages and under measurement conditions. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of multiple VIs and texture information and their combinations for estimating potato AGB across multiple growth stages. Texture information included a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and a multi-scale Gabor wavelet texture. The Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with four different kernel functions was employed to establish AGB estimation models using VIs, GLCM-based texture, Gabor-based texture, and their combinations. For the tuber formation stage, VIs combined with GLCM-based texture significantly reduced the prediction error of the model (rRMSE = 0.20). For the tuber bulking and starch accumulation stages, GLCM-based texture combined with Gabor-based texture produced the lowest prediction errors (rRMSE = 0.15 and 0.13), positively affecting the model for different years and various conditions (low–high AGB values and over- and underestimation). For multiple growth stages, the two texture features combined with GPR produced the lowest prediction errors (rRMSE = 0.16). This study demonstrated that VIs combined with multiple texture features could further improve the performance of AGB estimation at different stages.},

This study aimed to develop deep learning-based segmentation models in identifying weeds in potato fields captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) orthophotos and to explore the effects of weeds on potato yield. Previous studies predominantly employed U-Net for weed segmentation, but its performance often declines under complex field environments and low-image resolution conditions. Some studies attempted to overcome this limitation by reducing flight altitude or using high-cost cameras, but these approaches are not always practical. To address these challenges, this study uniquely integrated Real-ESRGAN Super-Resolution (SR) for UAV image enhancement and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semi-automatic annotation. Subsequently, we trained the YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN models for segmentation. Results showed that the detection accuracy mAP50 scores were 0.902 and 0.920 for YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN, respectively. Real-ESRGAN reconstruction slightly improved accuracy. When multiple weed types were present, accuracy generally decreased. The YOLOv8 model characterized plant and weed coverage areas could explained 41.2 \% of potato yield variations (R2 = 0.412, p-value = 0.01), underscoring the practical utility of UAV-based segmentation for yield estimation. Both YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN achieved high accuracy, with YOLOv8 converging faster. While different nitrogen fertilizer treatments had no significant effect on yield, weed control treatments significantly impacted yield, highlighting the importance of precise weed mapping for spot-specific weed management. This study provides insights into weed segmentation using Deep Leaning and contributes to environmentally friendly precision weed control.},
