I am a PhD student in remote sensing and geospatial AI at the Precision Agriculture Lab, Technical University of Munich. My research interests include remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral UAV and satellite imaging, and machine-learning methods for ecosystem-biodiversity characterisation, precision agriculture, and hydrological analysis. I am involved in the “Interdisciplinary approaches to assess biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban agriculture” project’s field campaigns and modelling workflows.
