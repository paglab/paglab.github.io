bio: My research interests are Agricultural Digital Twin and Smart Breeding. My project focuses on the construction of a Digital Twin system for maize, aiming to fuse Genetic x Environmental x Management data to construct a high-precision and dynamically updated maize growth virtual twin. By introducing a DNA language model with a multimodal fusion approach, I hope to achieve accurate simulation of maize phenotypes and breeding to support sustainable agricultural development.
