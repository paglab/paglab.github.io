## Overview

**AmAIzed** is a collaborative initiative between the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences (HSWT), and the Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture (LfL), funded by the AgroMissionHub. 
The project aims to develop a multi-tasking AI-assisted robotic system for individualized management of crops and weeds.

## Objectives

- **Reduce pesticide usage**: Aligning with EU targets to cut the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50%.
- **Enhance precision agriculture**: Utilizing AI and robotics to manage crops and weeds at the individual plant level.
- **Promote sustainable farming**: Minimizing soil compaction and environmental impact through lightweight robotic solutions.

## Methodology

The project brings together experts in:

- Agro- and Bio-Engineering
- Crop & Horticulture Science
- Plant Protection
- Farm Management

By integrating state-of-the-art technologies such as integrated pest management (IPM) and sensor-based variable rate herbicide application, AmAIzed seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional mechanical weeding and contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices.
