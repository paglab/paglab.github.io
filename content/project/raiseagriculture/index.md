The **RAISEAgriculture Start-up Project** is an innovative initiative based at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) Precision Agriculture Lab, in collaboration with the [TUM Venture Lab](https://www.tum-venture-labs.de/labs/food-agro-biotech/),
aiming to develop RAISE Agriculture â€” an autonomous, drone-based monitoring system for the early detection of stress zones in sugar beet and potato fields in Germany.

The founding team envisions to revolutionize sustainable farming practices through the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced drone technology. Supported by the [EXIST Business Start-up Grant](https://exist.de/en/programm/exist-gruendungsstipendium/), the project focuses on developing an **Autonomous Drone Servicing System (ADSS)** designed to assist farmers in monitoring crop health and optimizing resource utilization.

Key objectives of the project include:

- **AI-Powered Crop Monitoring**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze drones data for real-time crop health assessment.

- **Resource Optimization**: Implementing predictive models to guide fertilizer and pest control measures.

- **Farmer Support Systems**: Developing user-friendly platforms to provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations.

Through these efforts, the RAISEAgriculture Project Team aims to contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture, promoting environmental sustainability and economic viability for farmers.

After the project at TUM, the RAISEAgriculture team established their own company [project website](https://website-f7f20.web.app/about).
