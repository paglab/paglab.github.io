## Overview

**PRECISION** is a collaborative research project coordinated by the University of Luxembourg and co-lead by Technical University of Munich, focusing on enhancing sustainability in wheat farming. 
The project aims to develop advanced machine learning models that utilize drone-based remote sensing data to optimize nitrogen fertilization and weed control strategies.

## Objective

- **Enhance crop yield and Reduce environmental impact**: Utilize high-resolution data collected during the growing season to inform precise application of fertilizers and herbicides, thus optimizing resource use efficiency.

## Methodology

The project integrates expertise from geospatial engineering, remote sensing, and agronomy to:

- **Collect high-resolution data**: Employ drones equipped with LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging sensors to gather detailed information on crop health and field conditions.
- **Develop AI models**: Create machine learning algorithms capable of analyzing collected data to provide actionable insights for farmers.
- **Field testing**: Implement and validate the developed technologies at test fields, including those of the Institute for Organic Agriculture and
Agroecology Luxembourg (IBLA), Luxembourg and Technical University of Munich.

## Collaboration and Funding

PRECISION is a joint effort involving:

- **University of Luxembourg**
- **Technical University of Munich**
- **Institute for Organic Agriculture and Agroecology Luxembourg (IBLA), Luxembourg**
- **Lyc√©e Technique Agricole**

The project is funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Viticulture and Rural Development (MAVDR).
