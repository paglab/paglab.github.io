🛰️🌱 Boosting Nitrogen Use Efficiency from Space 🌱🛰

From ground to sky — our satellite remote sensing projects (GreenWindows, LiveSen-MAP, PHENET) are paving the way for precision nitrogen fertilization!🚜📡

By integrating high-resolution satellite imagery with field data and machine learning models, we’re developing tools to detect spatial variability in plant nitrogen needs, optimize inputs, and reduce environmental impacts. 

With every pixel, we’re getting closer to smarter, greener farming.

Stay tuned as we transform satellite data into better yields. 💡🌾
