We had an amazing time showcasing our drone technology and AI-powered agricultural innovations at the FarmVision Festival ðŸŒ¾ on the TUM Weihenstephan campus! 
Organized by the TUM School of Life Sciences and the Hans Eisenmann-Forum (HEF), the event brought together science, technology, and the public in a fun and interactive way.
