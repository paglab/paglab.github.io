Our **PrecisionAg Lab** proudly contributes to the *M.Sc. Agricultural Systems Sciences* program at TUM, which prepares the next generation of experts in sustainable agricultural production systems. 
This interdisciplinary program investigates the complex interplay between soil, crops, livestock, technology, the environment, and society. 

In this featured image,  our lab members prepared a UAV drone equipped with a multispectral sensor — a key tool in our research on **precision agriculture** and **plant phenotyping**. 
We integrate this aerial technology into our teaching by combining:
- 🚁️ **Drone-based remote sensing workflows**
- 💻 **Data analysis using AI and geospatial tools**
- 🌾 **Field-based agronomic applications**
- 🎓 **Research-driven teaching modules**

Students gain hands-on experience collecting and analyzing high-resolution imagery to understand field spatial variability, plant and soil health, and landscape characteristics and dynamics.
