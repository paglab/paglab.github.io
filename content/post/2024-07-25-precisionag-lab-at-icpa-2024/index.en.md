üéâ We‚Äôre proud to share that **four PhD students** (including a guest student) from the Precision Agriculture Lab at TUM participated in the **16th International Conference on Precision Agriculture (ICPA)**, held from **21‚Äì24 July 2024** in **Manhattan, Kansas, USA**.

### üì¢ Highlights:

**Xiaokai Chen** presented a poster: *Improving winter wheat plant nitrogen concentration prediction by combining proximal hyperspectral sensing and weather information*

**Xuefeng Xu** gave a presentation: *Detecting Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) using Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices under Different Nitrogen Conditions*  

**Jie Wang** gave a presentation: *Evaluating Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Wheat Using UAV Multispectral Images*

**Jingcheng Zhang** gave a talk on: *UAV-based Phenotyping of Nitrogen Responses in Winter Wheat*
