Bachelor students from the Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences program at the TUM School of Life Sciences joined an excursion to DÃ¼rnast research station. 
During the visit, students gained hands-on experience with plant and soil spectral measurements and explored machine learning methods for analyzing spectral data. 

The day also featured lively discussions on the use of drones, AI, and advanced sensing technologies in agriculture. Many thanks to *Subash and Yasamin* for helping organize the exercise and preparing for the samples.
