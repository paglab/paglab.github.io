abstract: 'Ensuring food security through sustainable practices while reducing greenhouse
  gas emissions are key challenges in modern agriculture. Utilising genetic variability
  within a crop species to identify varieties with higher root biomass carbon (C)
  could help address these challenges. It is thus crucial to quantify and understand
  intra-specific above- and belowground performance under varying environmental conditions.
  The study objectives were to: (a) quantify root biomass and depth distribution in
  different winter wheat varieties under various pedoclimatic conditions, (b) investigate
  the influence of variety and pedoclimatic conditions on the relationship between
  above- and belowground biomass production, and (c) assess whether optimised winter
  wheat variety selection can lead to both greater root biomass C and yield, boosting
  C accrual. Root biomass, root distribution to 1 m soil depth and root-to-shoot ratios
  were assessed in 10 different winter wheat varieties grown at 11 experimental sites
  covering a European climatic gradient from Spain to Norway. Median root biomass
  down to 1 m depth was 1.4 ± 0.7 Mg ha−1. The primary explanatory factor was site,
  accounting for 60\% of the variation in root biomass production, while the genetic
  diversity between wheat varieties explained 9.5\%. Precipitation had a significantly
  negative effect on total root biomass, especially in subsoil. Significant differences
  were also observed between varieties in root-to-shoot ratios and grain yield. The
  difference between the variety with the lowest root biomass and the one with the
  highest across sites was on average 0.9 Mg ha−1 which is an increase of 45\%. Pedoclimatic
  conditions had a greater influence than variety, and determined the relationship''s
  direction between root biomass and grain yield. A site-specific approach is, therefore,
  needed to realise the full potential for increased root biomass and yield offered
  by optimised variety selection.'
