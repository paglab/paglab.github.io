abstract: Crop senescence phenotyping usually relies on visual assessment, which,
  however, is time-consuming and cannot reflect the dynamic process of the physiological
  senescence of plants. Thus, high throughput and non-destructive methods are needed
  to capture the senescence dynamics. This study proposes a new method for assessing
  senescence based on spectral in wheat leaves. A suite of spectral indices (SIs)
  related to the absorption signals of chlorophylls and anthocyanins were calculated
  from the multispectral images acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The
  preliminary results hold promise for the development of new traits to identify genetic
  regulators of crop senescence.
