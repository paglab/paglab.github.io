abstract: Although unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely used for
  high-throughput crop monitoring, few attempts have been made to assess nitrogen
  content (NC) at the organ level and its association with nitrogen use efficiency
  (NUE). Also, little is known about the performance of UAV-based image texture features
  of different spectral bands in monitoring crop nitrogen and NUE. In this study,
  multi-spectral images were collected throughout different stages of winter wheat
  in two independent field trials - a single-variety field trial and a multi-variety
  trial in 2021 and 2022, respectively in China and Germany. Forty-three multispectral
  vegetation indices (VIs) and forty texture features (TFs) were calculated from images
  and fed into the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF)
  regression models for predicting nitrogen-related indicators. Our main objectives
  were to (1) assess the potential of UAV-based multispectral imagery for predicting
  NC in different organs of winter wheat, (2) explore the transferability of different
  image features (VI and TF) and trained machine learning models in predicting NC,
  and (3) propose a technical workflow for mapping NUE using UAV imagery. The results
  showed that the correlation between different features (VIs and TFs) and NC in different
  organs varied between the pre-anthesis and post-anthesis stages. PLSR latent variables
  extracted from those VIs and TFs could be a great predictor for nitrogen agronomic
  efficiency (NAE). While adding TFs to VI-based models enhanced the model performance
  in predicting NC, inconsistency arose when applying the TF-based models trained
  based on one dataset to the other independent dataset that involved different varieties,
  UAVs, and cameras. Unsurprisingly, models trained with the multi-variety dataset
  show better transferability than the models trained with the single-variety dataset.
  This study not only demonstrates the promise of applying UAV-based imaging to estimate
  NC in different organs and map NUE in winter wheat but also highlights the importance
  of conducting model evaluations based on independent datasets.
