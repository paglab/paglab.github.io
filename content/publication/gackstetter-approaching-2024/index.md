abstract: 'The process of crop type mapping generates land use maps, which serve as
  critical tools for efficient evaluation of production factors and impacts of agricultural
  practice. Yet, despite the necessity for comprehensive solutions in space and time,
  the state of research still exhibits significant limitations in these two dimensions:
  (1) From a temporal perspective, the primary focus of past research in crop type
  mapping has been on the economically most meaningful, main-season crops, thereby
  largely neglecting the explicit study of off-season vegetation despite its pivotal
  roles in year-round management cycles. (2) Viewed spatially, study areas in crop
  type mapping show distinct limitations from a multi- and transnational standpoint,
  despite intense cross-regional and international interrelations of agricultural
  production and an increasing number of countries publishing crop reference data.
  With a focus on Europe, this research aims to tackle the two described shortcomings
  (a) by investigating to what extent a selection of major off-season, winter vegetation
  types in continental Europe can be classified and (b) by analyzing the transnational
  applicability of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) for remote
  sensing-based crop type mapping across the European Union (EU). This study uses
  ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellite data, EU’s administrative farming declarations, and HCAT
  labels to analyze off-season farming measures, based on a study period from late
  summer to spring, in Austria, France, Germany, and Slovenia. We demonstrate that
  deep learning models effectively identify major productive and agroecogically significant
  winter vegetation in continental Europe. HCAT proves thereby valuable for transnational
  crop classification, excelling in mixed-country experiments and showing potential
  for transfer learning. This study’s findings provide a solid foundation for advancing
  transnational as well as winter and all-year crop type mapping, thereby serving
  as contribution towards temporally and spatially holistic research on agricultural
  practices’ sociocultural, economic, and environmental impacts.'
