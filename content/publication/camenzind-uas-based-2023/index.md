abstract: Yield prediction of wheat using unmanned aerial systems requires the extraction
  of a few meaningful features from the images. To identify these features, a total
  of 52 different spectral indices and 14 statistics at 19 dates during the growth
  season were extracted from multispectral images. Texture features were found more
  useful for yield prediction during the stem elongation stage compared to vegetation
  indices. Building a random forest model using the features selected by the feature
  selection algorithm Boruta gave an RMSE of 34.7 g/m2 compared to 50.7 g/m2 by the
  model built with all available features. Feature selection therefore improved the
  stability of yield prediction.
