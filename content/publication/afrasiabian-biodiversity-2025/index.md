abstract: In urban community gardens, artificially managed ground cover types, including
  vegetative components and non-vegetative ground components, are both critical to
  ecological functioning. Yet, how these non-vegetative components influence spectral
  diversity in ways that are different from natural systems has not been addressed.
  This study investigated the potential of combining spectral and structural diversity
  variables, corresponding to the Spectral Variation and Height Variation Hypotheses,
  respectively, to monitor plant and ground cover diversity. These variables were
  derived from in-situ hyperspectral measurements, drone-based multispectral imagery
  and three-dimensional canopy height models. We examined four biodiversity variables
  including plant species richness, total plant abundances, ground cover entropy,
  and ground cover richness, across five urban community gardens over two years. Spectral
  diversity was calculated based on the Coefficient of Variation (CV), Spectral Angle
  Mapper (SAM), and Shannonâ€™s Entropy (Entropy) indices at multiple spectral ranges.
  Structural diversity variables, including canopy height variation and image texture
  features. Our results showed that RedEdge and Near-infrared (NIR) bands effectively
  captured compositional variation in ground cover, while visible wavelengths better
  reflected subtle differences in vegetative components. Texture features and height-based
  structural variables provided valuable insights into canopy complexity, particularly
  improving predictions of plant abundance and ground cover entropy. Finally, we found
  that integrating spectral and structural diversity variables further enhanced predictive
  performance due to considering canopy biochemical and structural differences. This
  multi-metric approach outperformed single-source analyses, underscoring the value
  of combining complementary remote sensing data for better interpreting urban garden
  biodiversity. Our findings highlight the importance of characterizing canopy structural
  heterogeneity in advancing biodiversity monitoring within these complex urban ecosystems.
