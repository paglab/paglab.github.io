abstract: Quantitative resistance is likely to be more durable than major gene resistance
  for controlling Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. Earlier studies hypothesized
  that resistance affecting the degree of host damage, as measured by the percentage
  of leaf area covered by STB lesions, is distinct from resistance that affects pathogen
  reproduction, as measured by the density of pycnidia produced within lesions. We
  tested this hypothesis using a collection of 335 elite European winter wheat cultivars
  that was naturally infected by a diverse population of Zymoseptoria tritici in a
  replicated field experiment. We used automated image analysis of 21,420 scanned
  wheat leaves to obtain quantitative measures of conditional STB intensity that were
  precise, objective, and reproducible. These measures allowed us to explicitly separate
  resistance affecting host damage from resistance affecting pathogen reproduction,
  enabling us to confirm that these resistance traits are largely independent. The
  cultivar rankings based on host damage were different from the rankings based on
  pathogen reproduction, indicating that the two forms of resistance should be considered
  separately in breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance. We hypothesize
  that these different forms of resistance are under separate genetic control, enabling
  them to be recombined to form new cultivars that are highly resistant to STB. We
  found a significant correlation between rankings based on automated image analysis
  and rankings based on traditional visual scoring, suggesting that image analysis
  can complement conventional measurements of STB resistance, based largely on host
  damage, while enabling a much more precise measure of pathogen reproduction. We
  showed that measures of pathogen reproduction early in the growing season were the
  best predictors of host damage late in the growing season, illustrating the importance
  of breeding for resistance that reduces pathogen reproduction in order to minimize
  yield losses caused by STB. These data can already be used by breeding programs
  to choose wheat cultivars that are broadly resistant to naturally diverse Z. tritici
  populations according to the different classes of resistance.
