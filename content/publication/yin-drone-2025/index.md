abstract: Accurately monitoring the crop aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for
  yield forecasting. Despite the advances in high-resolution RGB imagery using drone
  technologies, inconsistency remains regarding the use of color vegetation indices
  (VIs) and texture information in modeling AGB in different growth stages and under
  measurement conditions. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of multiple
  VIs and texture information and their combinations for estimating potato AGB across
  multiple growth stages. Texture information included a gray-level co-occurrence
  matrix (GLCM) and a multi-scale Gabor wavelet texture. The Gaussian Process Regression
  (GPR) model with four different kernel functions was employed to establish AGB estimation
  models using VIs, GLCM-based texture, Gabor-based texture, and their combinations.
  For the tuber formation stage, VIs combined with GLCM-based texture significantly
  reduced the prediction error of the model (rRMSE = 0.20). For the tuber bulking
  and starch accumulation stages, GLCM-based texture combined with Gabor-based texture
  produced the lowest prediction errors (rRMSE = 0.15 and 0.13), positively affecting
  the model for different years and various conditions (low–high AGB values and over-
  and underestimation). For multiple growth stages, the two texture features combined
  with GPR produced the lowest prediction errors (rRMSE = 0.16). This study demonstrated
  that VIs combined with multiple texture features could further improve the performance
  of AGB estimation at different stages.
