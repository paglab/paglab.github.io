abstract: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic relationships with the
  majority of land plants and are an important part of the soil microbial community
  in natural and agricultural ecosystems. These fungi promote water and nutrient acquisition
  by their host plant and regulate the allocation of photosynthetic carbon to soil.
  Both crop variety and environment affect naturally occurring mycorrhizal abundance
  in roots, but the relative importance of those factors for mycorrhization is largely
  unknown. In a field study covering a large pedoclimatic gradient across four European
  sites, we (i) compared the abundance of AM fungi in the roots of 10 modern winter
  wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties, (ii) evaluated the relative importance of
  variety and site for the variability in root colonization by AM fungi and (iii)
  tested the relationship between mycorrhizal abundance and grain yield. Root colonization
  by arbuscules and hyphae ranged from 10\% to 59\% and 20\% to 91\%, respectively,
  across all samples and varied by 8\% and 18\%, respectively, among varieties when
  averaged across sites. Variance decomposition analysis revealed a 10 times higher
  importance of site than variety for AM fungal root colonization. Specifically, we
  found the highest mycorrhizal abundance on the site with the most arid conditions
  and the lowest on the sites with low soil pH and high nutrient availability. Despite
  the low variability in mycorrhizal abundance among varieties, there were significant
  differences in both arbuscular and hyphal root colonization. However, this did not
  translate into an increase in yield as no significant relationships between mycorrhizal
  abundance at flowering and grain yield were detected. The consistent differences
  between wheat varieties in root colonization by AM fungi across European field sites
  underline that genetic drivers of mycorrhization are to some extent independent
  of the site. This highlights the relevance of breeding practices to shape a wheat
  variety's capacity for mycorrhizal symbiosis across a range of environmental conditions.
