abstract: Although unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely used for
  high-throughput crop monitoring, few attempts have been made to assess nitrogen
  content (NC) at the organ level and its impact on nitrogen use efficiency (NUE).
  Also, little is known about the performance of UAV-based image texture features
  in crop nitrogen and NUE monitoring. In this study, eight flying missions were carried
  out throughout different stages of winter wheat (from the jointing stage to the
  stage 25 days after flowering) to acquire multispectral images. Forty-three multispectral
  vegetation indices (VIs) and forty texture features (TFs) were calculated from images
  and fed into the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF)
  regression models for predicting nitrogen-related indicators. Our main purposes
  were to (1) evaluate the potential of UAV-based images to predict NC in different
  organs of winter wheat and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE); (2) compare the
  performances of VIs, TFs and the combination of them for nitrogen monitoring. The
  results showed that the correlation between different features (VIs and TFs) and
  NC in different organs varied between the vegetative and reproductive phases. Most
  of VIs were found to be positively correlated with NC, while most of the TFs were
  negatively correlated with NC. PLSR latent variables extracted from VIs and TFs
  explained 80\% of the variations in NAE. However, no significant differences were
  found between VIs and TFs in their performance in predicting NC in different organs.
  This study demonstrated the promise of applying UAV-based imaging to estimate NC
  and NAE in different organs of winter wheat.
