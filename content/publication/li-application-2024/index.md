abstract: Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient that profoundly impacts crop growth,
  yield, and overall quality. Misapplication of N fertilizers can negatively affect
  crop productivity and lead to adverse environmental outcomes. Given this challenge,
  unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing has steadily evolved into a cost-effective
  substitute for conventional destructive field sampling and laboratory analysis when
  determining cropsâ€™ N status. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review
  synthesising current and potential physiological and spectral indicators for assessing
  crop N status and comparing their respective attributes. Moreover, it scrutinizes
  the advantages and disadvantages of four distinct categories of crop N retrieval
  methodologies. This study described the processing flow of UAV images and compared
  the advantages and disadvantages of different UAV platforms and photogrammetry software.
  Additionally, the study analyzes the applications and developmental prospects of
  commonly employed UAV optical sensorsand multi-sensor information fusion technologies
  in monitoring crop N status. Finally, the paper delves into the primary challenges
  and prospective directions concerning assessing crop N status via UAV optical remote
  sensing. The purpose of this research review extends beyond offering theoretical
  and technical backing; it seeks to guide practical implementation strategies to
  foster the adoption and effective use of UAV optical remote sensing in evaluating
  crop N status.
