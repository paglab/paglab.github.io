abstract: Producing quantitative and reliable measures of crop disease is essential
  for resistance breeding, but is challenging and time consuming using traditional
  phenotyping methods. Hyperspectral remote sensing has shown potential for the detection
  of plant diseases, but its utility for phenotyping large and diverse populations
  of plants under field conditions requires further evaluation. In this study, we
  collected canopy hyperspectral data from 335 wheat varieties using a spectroradiometer,
  and we investigated the use of canopy reflectance for detecting the Septoria tritici
  blotch (STB) disease and for quantifying the severity of infection. Canopy- and
  leaf-level infection metrics of STB based on traditional visual assessments and
  automated analyses of leaf images were used as ground truth data. Results showed
  i) that canopy reflectance and the selected spectral indices show promise for quantifying
  STB infections, and ii) that the normalized difference water index (NDWI) showed
  the best performance in detecting STB compared to other spectral indices. Moreover,
  partial least squares (PLS) regression models allowed for an improvement in the
  prediction of STB metrics. The PLS discriminant analysis (PLSDA) model calibrated
  based on the spectral data of four reference varieties was able to discriminate
  between the diseased and healthy canopies among the 335 varieties with an accuracy
  of 93\% (Kappa = 0.60). Finally, the PLSDA model predictions allowed for the identification
  of wheat genotypes that are potentially more susceptible to STB, which was confirmed
  by the STB visual assessment. This study demonstrates the great potential of using
  canopy hyperspectral remote sensing to improve foliar disease assessment and to
  facilitate plant breeding for disease resistance.
