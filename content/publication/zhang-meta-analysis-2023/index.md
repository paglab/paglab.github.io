abstract: Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are increasingly vital in precision agriculture,
  offering detailed, real-time insights into plant health across multiple spectral
  domains. However, this technology's precision in estimating plant traits associated
  with Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), and the factors affecting this precision, are
  not well-documented. This review examines the capabilities of UASs in assessing
  NUE in crops. Our analysis specifically highlights how different growth stages critically
  influence NUE and biomass assessments in crops and reveals a significant impact
  of specific signal processing techniques and sensor types on the accuracy of remote
  sensing data. Optimized flight parameters and precise sensor calibration are underscored
  as key for ensuring the reliability and validity of collected data. Additionally,
  the review delves into how different canopy structures, like planophile and erect
  leaf orientations, uniquely influence spectral data interpretation. The study also
  recognizes the untapped potential of image texture features in UAV-based remote
  sensing for detailed analysis of canopy micro-architecture. Overall, this research
  not only underscores the transformative impact of UAS technology on agricultural
  productivity and sustainability but also demonstrates its potential in providing
  more accurate and comprehensive insights for effective crop health and nutrient
  management strategies.
