abstract: Feature selection methods are widely used to improve the performance of
  plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) estimation models. However, the performance of
  individual feature selection methods can vary across different environments due
  to various uncertainties. This study aimed to propose a hybrid feature selection
  method to accurately identify the sensitive bands for the PNC estimation. Field
  experiments with different potato cultivars and N treatments were carried out in
  the Inner Mongolia during 2018, 2019, and 2021. The results showed that the hybrid
  feature selection method can effectively identify the sensitive bands for PNC. When
  combined with variational heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression (VHGPR), the
  hybrid method significantly improves the prediction accuracy of potato PNC. Validation
  using an independent dataset demonstrated that the hybrid feature selection method
  achieved the highest prediction accuracy compared to traditional feature selection
  methods, with the mean coefficient of determination (R²) increasing by 16.27 \%.
  Additionally, the performance of VHGPR was benchmarked against partial least squares
  regression (PLSR). The results indicated that the VHGPR model outperforms the PLSR
  model across various data types, with a mean R² improvement of 8.92 \%. In conclusion,
  combining the hybrid feature selection method with VHGPR can facilitate real-time
  PNC estimation in the field, thereby assisting farmers in accurately applying nitrogen
  fertilization strategies.
