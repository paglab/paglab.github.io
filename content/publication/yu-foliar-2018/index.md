abstract: 'Urban trees play a key role in mitigating environmental problems in cities,
  but they often face harsh environmental conditions as they generally grow in sealed
  soils that have small rooting space and low water availability. In this context,
  rapid monitoring and assessment of tree health status is critical to maintain urban
  trees and secure the provisioning of urban ecosystem services. Across three European
  cities we selected 187 Tilia tomentosa trees growing under following planting conditions:
  (i) sealed, trees planted in small soil pits or strips surrounded by highly sealed
  surfaces (concrete, pavement or asphalt); and (ii) unsealed, trees planted in roomy
  soil surfaces (e.g. parks). We measured leaf reflectance and fluorescence and derived
  a set of optical traits from the measurements. We examined whether these non-destructively
  measured optical traits differ between planting conditions and whether they correlate
  with leaf functional traits, e.g. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf water content (LWC)
  and leaf water per area (LWA). Compared to the unsealed trees, sealed trees showed
  decreased SLA and LWC while increased LWA. Leaf optical traits differed between
  the unsealed and sealed trees. Highly sealed soils accelerated leaf senescence of
  the sealed trees compared to the unsealed trees, embodied in the temporal trend
  of optical traits. Sealed planting conditions negatively affect urban tree health
  status and phenology. These negative effects can be estimated by leaf optical traits,
  demonstrating the great potential of optical traits in assessing tree health status.
  Our findings provide insights into facilitating urban green management using optical
  traits and remote sensing data.'
