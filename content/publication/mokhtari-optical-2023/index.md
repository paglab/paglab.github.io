abstract: In this study, a satellite-based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimation
  model, OPTRAM-ET, based on the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) estimates of soil
  moisture and a vegetation index (VI) was introduced and its application for crop
  yield estimation using a light use efficiency (LUE) model was assessed. The OPTRAM-ET
  model was applied to Sentinel-2 and evaluated against ETa estimates of 8 eddy covariance
  towers in the south of Germany. The proposed model showed promising performance
  with RMSE of 0.82 mm/day. In addition, its performance for winter wheat yield estimation
  was satisfactory with R2 of 0.46 and RMSE of 2.77 t/ha. This model allowed for ETa
  and crop yield maps with increased spatial resolution compared with thermal-based
  methods.
