abstract: 'Monitoring in situ chlorophyll (Chl) content in agricultural crop leaves
  is of great importance for stress detection, nutritional state diagnosis, yield
  prediction and studying the mechanisms of plant and environment interaction. Numerous
  spectral indices have been developed for chlorophyll estimation from leaf- and canopy-level
  reflectance. However, in most cases, these indices are negatively affected by variations
  in canopy structure and soil background. The objective of this study was to develop
  spectral indices that can reduce the effects of varied canopy structure and growth
  stages for the estimation of leaf Chl. Hyperspectral reflectance data was obtained
  through simulation by a radiative transfer model, PROSAIL, and measurements from
  canopies of barley comprising different cultivars across growth stages using spectroradiometers.
  We applied a comprehensive band-optimization algorithm to explore five types of
  spectral indices: reflectance difference (RD), reflectance ratio (RR), normalized
  reflectance difference (NRD), difference of reflectance ratio (DRR) and ratio of
  reflectance difference (RRD). Indirectly using the multiple scatter correction (MSC)
  theory, we hypothesized that RRD can eliminate adverse effects of soil background,
  canopy structure and multiple scattering. Published indices and multivariate models
  such as optimum multiple band regression (OMBR), partial least squares regression
  (PLSR) and support vector machines for regression (SVR) were also employed. Results
  showed that the ratio of reflectance difference index (RRDI) optimized for simulated
  data significantly improved the correlation with Chl (R2 = 0.98, p \&lt; 0.0001)
  and was insensitive to LAI variations (1â€“8), compared to widely used indices such
  as MCARI/OSAVI (R2 = 0.64, p \&lt; 0.0001) and TCARI/OSAVI (R2 = 0.74, p \&lt; 0.0001).
  The RRDI optimized for barley explained 76\% of the variation in Chl and outperformed
  multivariate models. However, the accuracy decreased when employing the indices
  for individual growth stages (R2 \&lt; 0.59). Accordingly, RRDIs optimized for open
  and closed canopies improved the estimations of Chl for individual stages before
  and after canopy closure, respectively, with R2 of 0.65 (p \&lt; 0.0001) and 0.78
  (p \&lt; 0.0001). This study shows that RRDI can efficiently eliminate the effects
  of structural properties on canopy reflectance response to canopy biochemistry.
  The results yet are limited to the datasets used in this study; therefore, transferability
  of the methods to large scales or other datasets should be further evaluated.'
