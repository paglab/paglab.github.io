abstract: Satellite remote sensing technology provides a promising means for near
  real-time monitoring of crop water status and requirements in agricultural and hydrological
  applications. Estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) often requires thermal
  information; however, not every satellite is equipped with a thermal sensor, which
  limits the estimation of ETa. To address this limitation, here we propose a satellite-based
  ETa estimation model, OPTRAM-ET, based on the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) estimates
  of soil moisture and a vegetation index (VI). We applied the OPTRAM-ET model to
  Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data and evaluated the model for ETa estimates
  using 16 eddy covariance flux towers in the United States and Germany with different
  landcover types, including agriculture, orchard, permanent wetland, and foothill
  forests. Next, OPTRAM-ET was compared with the conventional land surface temperature
  (LST)-VI model. The proposed OPTRAM-ET model showed promising performance over all
  the studied landcover types. In addition, OPTRAM-ET showed comparable performance
  to the conventional LST-VI model. However, since the OPTRAM-ET model does not need
  thermal data, it benefits from higher spatial and temporal resolution data provided
  by ever-increasing drone- and satellite-based optical sensors to predict crop water
  status and demand. Unlike the LST-VI model, which needs to be calibrated for each
  satellite image, a temporally-invariant region-specific calibration is possible
  in the OPTRAM-ET model. Therefore, OPTRAM-ET is substantially less computationally
  demanding than the LST-VI model.
