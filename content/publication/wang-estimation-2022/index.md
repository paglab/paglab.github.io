abstract: One of the problems of optical remote sensing of crop above-ground biomass
  (AGB) is that vegetation indices (VIs) often saturate from the middle to late growth
  stages. This study focuses on combining VIs acquired by a consumer-grade multiple-spectral
  UAV and machine learning regression techniques to (i) determine the optimal time
  window for AGB estimation of winter wheat and to (ii) determine the optimal combination
  of multi-spectral VIs and regression algorithms. UAV-based multi-spectral data and
  manually measured AGB of winter wheat, under five nitrogen rates, were obtained
  from the jointing stage until 25 days after flowering in the growing season 2020/2021.
  Forty-four multi-spectral VIs were used in the linear regression (LR), partial least
  squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF) models in this study. Results
  of LR models showed that the heading stage was the most suitable stage for AGB prediction,
  with R2 values varying from 0.48 to 0.93. Three PLSR models based on different datasets
  performed differently in estimating AGB in the training dataset (R2 = 0.74{\textasciitilde}0.92
