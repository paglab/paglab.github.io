abstract: The ability of a genotype to stay green affects the primary target traits
  grain yield (GY) and grain protein concentration (GPC) in wheat. High throughput
  methods to assess senescence dynamics in large field trials will allow for i) indirect
  selection in early breeding generations, when yield cannot yet be accurately determined
  and ii) mapping of the genomic regions controlling the trait. The aim of this study
  was to develop a robust method to assess senescence based on hyperspectral canopy
  reflectance. Measurements were taken in three years throughout the grain filling
  phase on {\textgreater}300 winter wheat varieties in the spectral range from 350
  to 2500 nm using a spectroradiometer. We compared the potential of spectral indices
  (SI) and full-spectrum models to infer visually observed senescence dynamics from
  repeated reflectance measurements. Parameters describing the dynamics of senescence
  were used to predict GY and GPC and a feature selection algorithm was used to identify
  the most predictive features. The three-band plant senescence reflectance index
  (PSRI) approximated the visually observed senescence dynamics best, whereas full-spectrum
  models suffered from a strong year-specificity. Feature selection identified visual
  scorings as most predictive for GY, but also PSRI ranked among the most predictive
  features while adding additional spectral features had little effect. Visually scored
  delayed senescence was positively correlated with GY ranging from r = 0.173 in 2018
  to r = 0.365 in 2016. It appears that visual scoring remains the gold standard to
  quantify leaf senescence in moderately large trials. However, using appropriate
  phenotyping platforms, the proposed index-based parameterization of the canopy reflectance
  dynamics offers the critical advantage of upscaling to very large breeding trials.
