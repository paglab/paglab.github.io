abstract: The influence of morphophysiological variation at different growth stages
  on the performance of vegetation indices for estimating plant N status has been
  confirmed. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining how this variation impacts
  hyperspectral measures and canopy N status are poorly understood. In this study,
  four field experiments involving different N rates were conducted to optimize the
  selection of sensitive bands and evaluate their performance for modeling canopy
  N status of rice at various growth stages in 2007 and 2008. The results indicate
  that growth stages negatively affect hyperspectral indices in different ways in
  modeling leaf N concentration (LNC), plant N concentration (PNC) and plant N uptake
  (PNU). Published hyperspectral indices showed serious limitations in estimating
  LNC, PNC and PNU. The newly proposed best 2-band indices significantly improved
  the accuracy for modeling PNU (R2 = 0.75–0.85) by using the lambda by lambda band-optimized
  algorithm. However, the newly proposed 2-band indices still have limitations in
  modeling LNC and PNC because the use of only 2-band indices is not fully adequate
  to provide the maximum N-related information. The optimum multiple narrow band reflectance
  (OMNBR) models significantly increase the accuracy for estimating the LNC (R2 =
  0.67–0.71) and PNC (R2 = 0.57–0.78) with six bands. Results suggest the combinations
  of center of red-edge (735 nm) with longer red-edge bands (730–760 nm) are very
  efficient for estimating PNC after heading, whereas the combinations of blue with
  green bands are more efficient for modeling PNC across all stages. The center of
  red-edge (730–735 nm) paired with early NIR bands (775–808 nm) are predominant in
  estimating PNU before heading, whereas the longer red-edge (750 nm) paired with
  the center of “NIR shoulder” (840–850 nm) are dominant in estimating PNU after heading
  and across all stages. The OMNBR models have the advantage of modeling canopy N
  status for the entire growth period. However, the best 2-band indices are much easier
  to use. Alternatively, it is also possible to use the best 2-band indices to monitor
  PNU before heading and PNC after heading. This study systematically explains the
  influences of N dilution effect on hyperspectral band combinations in relating to
  the different N variables and further recommends the best band combinations which
  may provide an insight for developing new hyperspectral vegetation indices.
