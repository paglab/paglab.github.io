abstract: Weeds significantly impact agricultural production, and traditional weed
  control methods often harm soil health and the environment. This study aims to develop
  deep learning based segmentation models in identifying weeds in potato fields captured
  by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) orthophotos and to explore the effects of weeds
  on potato yield. UAVs were used to collect RGB data from potato fields, flying at
  an altitude of 10m, with Real ESRGAN Super-Resolution (SR) enhancing image resolution.
  We applied the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to do semi-automatic annotation, followed
  by training the YOLOv8 and MASK-RCNN models for segmentation. Also we used ANOVA
  and linear regression to analyze the effects of weeds and nitrogen fertilizer on
  yield. Results showed that the detection accuracy mAP50 scores for YOLOv8 and Mask
  R-CNN were 0.902 and 0.920, respectively, with the Real-ESRGAN-enhanced model achieving
  0.909. When multiple weed types were present, accuracy decreased to 0.86. The linear
  regression model, incorporating plant and weed coverage areas, explained 41.2\%
  of yield variation (R2 = 0.412, p-value = 0.01). Both YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN achieved
  high accuracy, with YOLOv8 converging faster. Real-ESRGAN reconstruction slightly
  improved accuracy. Different nitrogen fertilizer treatments had no significant effect
  on yield, while weed control treatments significantly impacted yield, showing the
  importance of precise weed mapping. This study provides insights into weed segmentation
  and contributes to environmentally friendly precision weed control.
