abstract: 'Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is a non-destructive, fast, and low-cost
  method to measure the grain quality of different cereals. However, the feasibility
  for determining the critical biochemicals, related to the classifications for food,
  feed, and fuel products are not adequately investigated. Fourier-transform (FT)
  NIR was applied in this study to determine the eight biochemicals in four types
  of sorghum samples: hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours, whole grains, and
  grain flours. A total of 20 hybrids of sorghum grains were selected from the two
  locations in China. Followed by FT-NIR spectral and wet-chemically measured biochemical
  data, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to construct the prediction
  models. The results showed that sorghum grain morphology and sample format affected
  the prediction of biochemicals. Using NIR data of grain flours generally improved
  the prediction compared with the use of NIR data of whole grains. In addition, using
  the spectra of whole grains enabled comparable predictions, which are recommended
  when a non-destructive and rapid analysis is required. Compared with the hulled
  grain flours, hull-less grain flours allowed for improved predictions for tannin,
  cellulose, and hemicellulose using NIR data. This study aimed to provide a reference
  for the evaluation of sorghum grain biochemicals for food, feed, and fuel without
  destruction and complex chemical analysis.'
