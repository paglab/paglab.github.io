abstract: 'Declining urban tree health can affect critical ecosystem services, such
  as air quality improvement, temperature moderation, carbon storage, and biodiversity
  conservation. The application of state-of-the-art remote sensing data to characterize
  tree health has been widely examined in forest ecosystems. However, such application
  to urban trees has not yet been fully explored\&mdash;due to the presence of heterogeneous
  tree species and backgrounds, severely complicating the classification of tree health
  using remote sensing information. In this study, tree health was represented by
  a set of field-assessed tree health indicators (defoliation, discoloration, and
  a combination thereof), which were classified using airborne laser scanning (ALS)
  and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with a Random Forest classifier. Different classification
  scenarios were established aiming at: (i) Comparing the performance of ALS data,
  HSI and their combination, and (ii) examining to what extent tree species mixtures
  affect classification accuracy. Our results show that although the predictive power
  of ALS and HSI indices varied between tree species and tree health indicators, overall
  ALS indices performed better. The combined use of both ALS and HSI indices results
  in the highest accuracy, with weighted kappa coefficients (Kc) ranging from 0.53
  to 0.79 and overall accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. Overall, the most informative
  remote sensing indices indicating urban tree health are ALS indices related to point
  density, tree size, and shape, and HSI indices associated with chlorophyll absorption.
  Our results further indicate that a species-specific modelling approach is advisable
  (Kc points improved by 0.07 on average compared with a mixed species modelling approach).
  Our study constitutes a basis for future urban tree health monitoring, which will
  enable managers to guide early remediation management.'
