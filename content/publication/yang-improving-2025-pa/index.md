abstract: Timely and accurate monitoring of plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) is
  vital for optimizing field N management. Hyperspectral indices are commonly used
  as a predictor for monitoring the PNC of crops, but individual spectral indices
  are often susceptible to cultivars and growth stages. Machine learning (ML) is a
  promising method for mining more spectral variables to assess the PNC of crops.
  To monitor the PNC of potatoes, therefore, this study extended previous work to
  further use hyperspectral optimized spectral indices (OSI) as input variables of
  ML, while, comparing with the ML models that used full-spectrum (FS), existing spectral
  indices (ESI) and sensitive spectral bands (SSB) as input variables, as well as
  simple regression model based on OSI alone. The partial least squares regression
  (PLSR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural
  network (ANN) models were calibrated using a dataset encompassing three cultivars
  and critical fertigation growth stages under three to six N levels. The calibrated
  ML models were evaluated using the datasets from independent experiments and two
  farmersÂ´ fields. The OSI as an input variable in ML models showed superiority for
  predicting the potato PNC compared to FS, SSB, and ESI. The OSI-based RF model with
  an R2 of 0.79, RMSE of 0.27\%, and RPD of 2.18 had higher accuracy for predicting
  potato PNC than other ML models. Comparing the simple optimized spectral indices
  regression model alone, the OSI-based RF model reduced RMSE by mitigating the effects
  of cultivars and growth stages on PNC prediction. The OSI-based RF model significantly
  contributes to optimum fertilization management based on actual potato N status
  during critical growth periods.
