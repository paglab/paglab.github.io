abstract: '[Objectives]Monitoring crop moisture conditions in real-time is critical
  for adopting water-saving irrigation and reducing China’s present water scarcity.
  This study explores the feasibility of using drone multispectral image data for
  real-time monitoring of maize drought stress and compares the sensitivity of drone
  data and field-measured agronomic indicators to crop drought stress. [Methods]Two
  maize cultivars, ‘Fumin 985’ and ‘Zhengdan 958’, were used as test materials in
  the field experiment. Border irrigation, drip irrigation, and rainfed irrigation
  were employed as treatments. The pigment content and specific leaf area (SLA) of
  the most recently unfolded maize leaves were determined at 60, 70, 76, 84, 90, and
  95 days after sowing. Similarly, a UAV equipped with multi-spectral cameras was
  used to collect near-ground remote sensing data to extract five vegetation indexes:
  the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation
  index (GNDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), leaf chlorophyll index
  (LCI), and optimum soil adjust vegetation index (OSAVI). [Results]The changes in
  vegetation indexes were earlier than in the leaf pigment content and the leaf area
  index. At 70 days after sowing (tasseling period), there was a significant difference
  in the NDRE and LCI of the three treatments. NDVI, GNDVI, and OSAVI indexes differed
  between the irrigation and rain-fed modes. No difference was observed in the treatments''
  pigment content and specific leaf area index at the same stages. At 90 days following
  sowing, there was a considerable difference in pigment concentration among the treatments
  (filling period). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that the relationship
  between vegetation indexes and pigment content varied depending on the growth stage.
  The correlations between pigment content and two vegetation indices (NDRE and LCI)
  were higher for 80 days after sowing (flowering phase) than for NDVI, GNDVI, and
  OSAVI; for 90 days after sowing (filling period), the correlation between the five
  vegetation indices and pigment content was high. [Conclusions]According to this
  study, the utilization of UAV multi-spectral data to monitor maize drought proved
  better than some measured agronomic indicators. However, further research should
  be conducted on the best spectral indicators and periods for drought monitoring
  in various situations and environments. © 2022 by the authors.'
