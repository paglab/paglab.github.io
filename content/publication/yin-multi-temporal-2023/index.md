abstract: Spectral indices based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images
  combined with machine learning algorithms can more effectively assess chlorophyll
  content in plants, which plays a crucial role in plant nutrition diagnosis, yield
  estimation and a better understanding of plant and environment interactions. Therefore,
  the aim of this study was to use UAV-based spectral indices deriving from UAV-based
  multispectral images as inputs in different machine learning models to predict canopy
  chlorophyll content of potato crops. The relative chlorophyll content was obtained
  using a SPAD chlorophyll meter. Random Forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR),
  partial least squares regression (PLSR) and ridge regression (RR) were employed
  to predict the chlorophyll content. The results showed that RF model was the best
  performing algorithm with an R2 of 0.76, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.97.
  Both RF and SVR models showed much better accuracy than PLSR and RR models. This
  study suggests that the best models, RF model, allow to map the spatial variation
  in chlorophyll content of plant canopy using the UAV multispectral images at different
  growth stages.
