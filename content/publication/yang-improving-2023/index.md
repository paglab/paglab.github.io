abstract: Machine learning (ML) combined with hyperspectral reflectance is a hot research
  topic in the field of vegetation traits monitoring. However, due to the limited
  experimental data used to calibrate ML algorithms, ML model generalization ability
  needs to be urgently improved. This study aimed to improve the generalization ability
  of random forest (RF) for monitoring potato chlorophyll content by integrating experimental
  and simulated data. The calibration dataset consists of experimental and PROSAIL
  model simulated data. The RF model was validated using farmersâ€™ fields data. The
  results showed that the RF model calibrated by the integrated experimental and simulated
  data significantly improved the explanatory power of potato chlorophyll content
  by 23-47\% compared with the RF model calibrated with simulated or experimental
  data alone, and the R2 and RMSE were 0.67 and 0.08 g/m2. The results indicated that
  integrating the PROSAIL model simulated and experiment measured data could effectively
  compensate for the large amount of data required by ML when calibrating the model,
  thereby improving the generalization ability of the model.
