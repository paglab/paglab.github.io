abstract: In-season diagnosis of crop nitrogen (N) status is crucial for precision
  N management. Critical N (Nc) dilution curve and N nutrition index (NNI) have been
  proposed as effective methods to diagnose N status of different crops. The Nc dilution
  curves have been developed for indica rice in the tropical and temperate zones and
  japonica rice in the subtropical-temperate zone, but they have not been evaluated
  for short-season japonica rice in Northeast China. The objectives of this study
  were to evaluate the previously developed Nc dilution curves for rice in Northeast
  China and to develop a more suitable Nc dilution curve in this region. A total of
  17 N rate experiments were conducted in Sanjiang Plain, Heilongjiang Province in
  Northeast China from 2008 to 2013. The results indicated that none of the two previously
  developed Nc dilution curves was suitable to diagnose N status of the short-season
  japonica rice in Northeast China. A new Nc dilution curve was developed and can
  be described by the equation Nc = 27.7W−0.34 if W ≥ 1 Mg dry matter (DM) ha−1 or
  Nc = 27.7 g kg−1 DM if W {\textless} 1 Mg DM ha−1, where W is the aboveground biomass.
  This new curve was lower than the previous curves. It was validated using a separate
  dataset, and it could discriminate non-N-limiting and N-limiting nutritional conditions.
  Additional studies are needed to further evaluate it for diagnosing N status of
  different rice cultivars in Northeast China and develop efficient non-destructive
  methods to estimate NNI for practical applications.
