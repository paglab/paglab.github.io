abstract: Timely and accurate prediction of nitrogen (N) status in winter wheat is
  crucial for guiding precision N management. This study aimed to develop an efficient
  model for predicting winter wheat plant N concentration (PNC) by integrating proximal
  hyperspectral sensing data with weather information. Hyperspectral data were collected
  from six field experiments conducted from 2014 to 2023, which were preprocessed
  using first-order derivative, log-transformation, and continuum removal methods.
  Effective spectral bands were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection
  operator (LASSO), combined with weather information and analyzed using seven machine
  learning algorithms. The results indicated that first-order derivative-preprocessed
  bands combined with Elastic Net Regression provided the best PNC prediction (coefficient
  of determination (R2) = 0.78, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.28 \% and relative
  prediction deviation (RPD) = 2.15) among the tested methods. Combining proximal
  hyperspectral sensing and weather information with machine learning algorithms significantly
  enhanced winter wheat PNC predictions (R2 = 0.79–0.85, RMSE = 0.23–0.27 \% and RPD = 2.15–2.56)
  compared with using proximal hyperspectral sensing (R2 = 0.34–0.79, RMSE = 0.28–0.48 \%
  and RPD = 1.23–2.15) alone. This approach offers a promising framework for winter
  wheat PNC prediction to support precision N management. Future work should focus
  on developing multi-source data fusion strategies, incorporating unmanned aerial
  vehicle or satellite hyperspectral sensing and machine learning, for large-scale
  monitoring of crop N status and N management decision making.
