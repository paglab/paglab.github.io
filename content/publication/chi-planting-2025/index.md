abstract: Different urban planting contexts, such as streets and parks, can lead to
  significant intraspecific biochemical and structural variations in trees. These
  variations present challenges for remote sensing-based tree species classification
  and effective urban forest management. However, few studies have explored how planting
  contexts influence the accuracy of remote sensing-based tree species identification
  in urban environments. This study introduced a planting context-specific modelling
  approach (i.e., models trained for street trees and park trees separately) for classifying
  seven dominant broadleaved tree species in the Brussels Capital Region, Belgium
  using airborne hyperspectral and leaf-on LiDAR data. This approach was compared
  to a traditional general modelling approach. Linear discriminant analysis with principal
  component analysis was employed to classify tree species at the individual tree
  level using different feature sets. Our results showed that a planting context-specific
  modelling approach with combined hyperspectral and LiDAR features achieved an overall
  accuracy (OA) of 84.2\%. It improved the OA of LiDAR-based classifications by 7.6
  and 8.9 percentage points for street trees and park trees respectively and of hyperspectral-based
  street tree species classification by 4.2 percentage points. The decreased discriminatory
  power of features in general models can be partly attributed to their sensitivity
  to planting context. We concluded that a planting context-specific modeling approach
  can enhance urban tree species classification, ultimately supporting improved urban
  forest management.
