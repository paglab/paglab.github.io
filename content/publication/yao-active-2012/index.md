abstract: China consumes more than 1/3 of global N fertilizers for rice with less
  than 1/5 of the world rice planting area. As a consequence, N efficiency is low
  and nitrate pollution risk is high. Developing efficient N management strategies
  and technologies for rice are therefore needed. Here, we developed an active canopy
  sensor-based precision N management strategy for rice in Northeast China. Four site-years
  of field N rate experiments were conducted in 2008 and 2009 in Sanjiang Plain, Heilongjiang,
  China. The GreenSeeker active sensor was used to collect rice canopy reflectance
  data at different growth stages. Three on-farm experiments were conducted in 2011
  to evaluate the performance of the developed strategy. The results show that the
  crop sensor can be used to calculate rice yield potential without additional topdressing
  N application at stem elongation or booting stage. The GreenSeeker-based precision
  N management strategy has a regional optimum N rate of 90–110 kg N ha−1 as initial
  total amount and 45 and 20 \% as basal and tillering N application. It uses the
  crop sensor to estimate the topdressing N rate at stem elongation stage. GreenSeeker-based
  precision management and chlorophyll meter-based site-specific N management increased
  the partial factor productivity of farmers by 48 and 65 \%, respectively, without
  significant change in grain yield. The crop sensor-based N management strategy can
  therefore improve N use efficiency of rice. It is more suitable for practical on-farm
  applications, and will contribute to the sustainable development of rice farming.
