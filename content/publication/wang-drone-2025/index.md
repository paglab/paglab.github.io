abstract: Drone remote sensing offers a powerful tool for monitoring vegetation and
  agricultural systems. However, its effectiveness in assessing the effect of soil
  mineral nitrogen (Nmin) on crop canopy traits remains inadequately explored. This
  study investigates the relationship between soil Nmin variability and canopy characteristics,
  grain yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and explores the potential to predict
  NUE using drone multispectral images. Multispectral data were collected across growth
  stages over two growing seasons. The analysis revealed that soil Nmin significantly
  affected canopy structure, with low Nmin inducing a ’blue shift’ of the red-edge
  spectral position. The multilayer perceptron regression model predicted NUE with
  high accuracy (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7) in early growth stages, identifying red-edge
  spectral indices and canopy height as key predictors. Texture features did not play
  a significant role in the models for predicting NUE, which remains to be further
  understood in future research. These findings highlight the capability of UAV remote
  sensing data, especially the red-edge spectral features, to capture the effects
  of soil Nmin on canopy traits. This study provides a proof-of-concept for mapping
  NUE using UAV images, with the final goal of improving crop nitrogen management
  and fertilizer use efficiency in agriculture.
