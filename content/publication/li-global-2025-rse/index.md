abstract: Canopy chlorophyll content per ground area (CCC, g·m−2) is tightly related
  to vegetation photosynthesis and is a promising indicator of photosynthetic capacity.
  However, a global operational CCC product is not yet available. To fill this gap,
  we developed a two-step upscaling method to estimate global CCC from Sentinel-3
  OLCI top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. In the first step, a physically-based
  PROSAIL-D inversion model produced accurate CCC maps from over 20,000 high-spatial
  resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral images collected across 50 sites within
  the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) between 2019 and 2021. The validation
  against ground CCC measurements showed an R2 of 0.89 and an RMSE of 0.30 g·m−2.
  In the second step, these high-resolution CCC maps were resampled or upscaled to
  a spatial resolution of 300 m, and combined with Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance
  images to train random forest (RF) models. The RF model demonstrated robust performance
  with leave-one-site-out cross-validation, yielding an R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 0.14 g·m−2.
  The two-step method also showed minimal sensitivity to angular effects and land
  cover variations, underscoring its robustness. In comparison, the traditional direct
  inversion method (the one-step method) led to underestimation of CCC by 0.16 g·m−2
  and a moderate estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.30 g·m−2). We generated
  a long-term global OLCI CCC product using Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance data from
  2016 to 2024, which can also be continuously updated using current data. This global
  CCC product can provide important plant physiological information, for parameterizing
  terrestrial biosphere models and capturing spatiotemporal photosynthetic patterns,
  thereby advancing research on vegetation carbon dynamics cycles at the global scale.
