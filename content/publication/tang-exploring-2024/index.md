abstract: Ensuring global food security depends heavily on attaining and sustaining
  high maize yields. However, effective N fertilisation management and precise predictions
  of maize yields require accurate and timely estimation of leaf chlorophyll content
  (LCC). In this study, we determined the optimal spectral features for predicting
  LCC in maize by comparing spectral indices and wavelet features. The robustness
  of the wavelet functions in estimating maize LCC was evaluated, and the results
  showed that LCC was strongly correlated with the wavelet coefficient between 400
  and 800 nm, located at higher scales (9 and 10). The best wavelet function for estimating
  LCC was the Mexican hat (Mexh) continuous wavelet transform (CWT) (W718, S9). Compared
  with the currently accepted best spectral index model (mND705, R2 = 0.80–0.95),
  the LCC estimation model based on the CWT wavelet function (Mexh, R2 = 0.90–0.98)
  was more accurate. The newly developed model was validated using two independent
  datasets, from 2017 and 2018, yielding root mean squared errors of 2.35 and 2.39
  μg/cm2, respectively. The relative errors of LCC estimation obtained by the new
  model were 3.70\% and 3.62\%, respectively. Validations based on the PROSPECT model
  confirmed the robustness and stability of the CWT Mexh function compared to the
  best-performing spectral indices. In conclusion, the higher estimation accuracy
  of the Mexh function-based wavelet transform across growth stages, leaf layers,
  locations, and varieties demonstrated the universality and stability of the wavelet
  transform approach in estimating maize LCC.
