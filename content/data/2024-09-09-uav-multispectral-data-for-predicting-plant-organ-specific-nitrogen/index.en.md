This dataset supports the study published in [**Wang F et al., 2025**](/publication/wang-characterization-2025/), which developed machine learning models to estimate nitrogen content in winter wheat using UAV-based multispectral data.

The data includes:

- Forty-three multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and forty texture features (TFs)
- Field measurements of plant nitrogen content in two field trials
- These data were collected in 2021 and 2022, with DJI P4 MS and Micasense, respectively 
- original images and organ specific nitrogen data will be available on request.
