Efficient nitrogen management is critical for balancing agricultural productivity with environmental sustainability. Traditional nitrogen practices often fall short when it comes to evaluating both **soil nitrogen availability** and **plant nitrogen content**, or applying fertilizers with optimal timing and spatial accuracy.

This **special issue** of *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture* brings together innovative research focused on **advanced sensing and application technologies** for nitrogen. These tools enable real-time, data-driven decision-making in the field, leading to improved better crop yields and quality, and reduced ecological footprint.

### ðŸ§  Topics include:
- Real-time nitrogen sensing
- Remote and proximal sensing of nitrogen status
- Sensing data-driven variable rate application
- Decision support systems for nutrient management
- Data fusion from soil, plant, and sensor sources

### ðŸ“… Submission Deadline
**31 December 2024** (closed)

### ðŸ‘¥ Guest Editors:
- **Alireza Pourreza** (UC Davis)
- **Ali Moghimi** (Virginia Tech)
- **Terry Bates** (Cornell University)
- **Kang Yu** (Technical University of Munich)
