summary: An example event.
abstract: 'This hands-on event is organized in conjunction with the Master’s course “Drone Remote Sensing Meets AI”, 
bringing together students and researchers to tackle real-world challenges at the intersection of drone remote sensing technology and artificial intelligence. 
Throughout the week, participants will work in teams to develop and test AI-powered solutions for processing drone-acquired imagery, addressing agricultural tasks such as object detection, classification of crop types or stress conditions, and regression-based trait prediction. 
The event fosters an interactive environment where cutting-edge UAV data meets machine learning workflows — encouraging innovation, collaboration, and critical thinking in precision agriculture.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).
