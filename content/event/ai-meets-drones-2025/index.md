summary: A deep learning week.
abstract: 'This event is organized in conjunction with the Master’s course “Drone Remote Sensing Meets AI”, 
bringing together students and researchers to tackle real-world challenges at the intersection of drone remote sensing technology and artificial intelligence. 
Throughout the week, participants will work in teams to develop and test AI-powered solutions for processing drone-acquired imagery, addressing agricultural tasks such as object detection, classification of crop types or stress conditions, and regression-based trait prediction. 
The event fosters an interactive environment where cutting-edge UAV data meets machine learning workflows — encouraging innovation, collaboration, and critical thinking in precision agriculture.'
