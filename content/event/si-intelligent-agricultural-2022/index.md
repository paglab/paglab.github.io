The labor shortage and rising costs in agriculture have led to a bottleneck, prompting the emergence of smart agriculture as a solution. Sensor-based technologies play a pivotal role in this transformation. With rapid advancements in sensing and AI-based vision technologies, intelligent agricultural applications are increasingly being implemented, utilizing advanced sensor technologies to develop novel tools that reduce labor.

This Special Issue, *Intelligent Agricultural Applications with Sensing and Vision System*, aims to bring together recent research and developments concerning novel sensing and vision systems applied in agriculture. We welcome papers addressing sensing and vision systems for a wide range of agricultural tasks, including, but not limited to, recent research and developments in the following areas:

- Advanced imaging technology: hyper-spectral, multispectral, fluorescence, thermal, 3-dimension imaging technology;
- AI-driven phenotypic analysis: crop yield estimation, dynamic growth prediction, health status determination, microorganism and pest identification;
- High-throughput phenotyping;
- Airborne sensors (UAVs);
- AI cloud or edge computing application;
- Sensors for robotic applications in crop management;
- Sensors for positioning, navigation and obstacle detection.
